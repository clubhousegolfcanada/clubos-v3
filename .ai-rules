# AI Execution Rules (Highest Leverage)

## 1. Quick Context (30 seconds)
```bash
cat CURRENT_WORK.md              # Active work
grep "HANDOFF" CURRENT_WORK.md  # Previous session
```
If needed: `cat CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md`

## 2. Copy First, Create Second
- Find similar code FIRST
- Copy and modify
- Only create new if nothing similar exists

## 3. Ship Working Code
- Working > Perfect
- Patterns > Creativity
- Done > Discussing

## 4. Update Context
- Category CHANGELOG.md after changes
- CURRENT_WORK.md during work
- Leave breadcrumbs

## 5. No Overthinking
- 10 min rule: Start coding
- Use existing patterns
- npm install solutions

## 6. Be Practical
- Build what users actually ask for
- Implement improvements when pain is felt
- Use feature flags for optional complexity
- Every rule can be broken for good reason
- Focus on shipping value, not following rules
