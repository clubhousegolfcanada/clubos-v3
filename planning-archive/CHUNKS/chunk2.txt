Claude Breakdown: Chunk 2 ? Message Flow, Thread State, and Escalation Logic

? Scope

Define how ClubOS V2 handles incoming customer messages, classifies intent, routes to actions, and escalates if required. Establish internal thread state tracking and escalation decision logic.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionStatic message parsing? Message flow is live-classified + context-awareNo thread states? Threads are assigned status with intent + stateHuman-only escalation? AI escalates based on configured failure thresholds
?? Dependencies
* OperatorGPT must:
o Receive message input
o Access booking + system state (NinjaOne, DB)
o Maintain message ? thread linkage
* Escalation paths configured per category
* Optional: Slack fallback for human escalation

?? Tasks

[2.1] Message Flow Routing
* Incoming messages are processed in real time
* Each message is classified by intent:
{
  "intent": "tech_issue",
  "sub_intent": "trackman_freeze",
  "confidence": 0.93
}
* 
* Matched to SOPs via vector search or tag
* Booking + bay context is attached

[2.2] Define Thread Status Enum

Every customer thread stores a live status:
"awaiting_response" |
"ai_resolved" |
"escalated" |
"in_progress" |
"resolved" |
"manual_override"
LLM uses status + last action to decide next step.

[2.3] Escalation Trigger Logic

Escalation is triggered when:
* autonomy = false for category
* Or SOP fails (e.g. reset unsuccessful and no fallback allowed)
* Or customer replies with negative sentiment (e.g. ?still not working?)
* Or AI confidence falls below minimum threshold

Escalation triggers:
* Slack alert (if enabled)
* Thread moves to "escalated"
* Operator gets inline summary of what was attempted

[2.4] AI Retry Behavior

Controlled via per-action config:
{
  "category": "tech",
  "max_fallbacks": 1,
  "retry_delay": 2,
  "await_customer_feedback": true
}
Retry logic always waits for:
* Booking data
* Customer reply
* System status confirmation

? Expected Behavior
* Every customer message is routed through a thread with tracked status
* AI attempts 1?2 known resolutions (if allowed), then escalates
* Threads are not freeform chats ? they follow intent ? action ? feedback ? status
* Operators can view thread state, actions taken, and escalation history
