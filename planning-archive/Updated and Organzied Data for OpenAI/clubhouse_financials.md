- **Fiscal Year End**: May 31

  - Flagship operational for ~6 months
- **Revenue**: Generated $400K–$450K despite staggered rollout and partial-year capacity

### 2. Current State & Confirmed Expansion

- **Fall Expansion**: 3 more Clubhouse locations planned and confirmed

### 3. Three-Year Forward Projections

#### FY2026 (Year 3)
- +3 confirmed Clubhouse sites added
- Expansion of partner golf course installs (rent-free, revenue-share model)
- External ClubOS clients onboarded
- Hardware sales (BenQ projectors + custom PCs) scaling via ClubOS footprint

#### FY2027 (Year 4)
- Platform-first growth model
- ClubOS as backbone for third-party operators
- Recurring revenue: SaaS, partner installs, support contracts

### 4. Revenue Streams
| Stream                     | Status                         | Strategy                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Simulator Rentals         | Validated, $25/hr, high use    | Add bays, sites, partner installs      |
| Hardware Sales            | Proven in 4 provinces           | Scale via B2B ClubOS channel           |
| ClubOS SaaS               | In production                   | Offer to operators (e.g., Better Golf) |
| Support Automation        | Bundled w/ ClubOS               | Becomes recurring revenue              |
| Golf Course Installs      | River Oaks secured              | Expand via free-rent model             |

### 5. ClubOS as Operating Core
- **Automation Coverage**: Handles over 90% of all customer contact
- **Customer Training**: Customers are trained to text, not call, ensuring structured data flow
- **AI Functions**:
  - Manages general inquiries
  - Stores structured logs
  - Rollout includes booking edits and remote TrackMan resets
- **Escalation Logic**:
  - If AI fails or customer responds negatively (e.g. "doesn’t work"), issue escalates instantly
  - **Clubhouse team** (3–5 core members) answers manually
- **No staff needed on-site**: All operations centralized and automated

### 6. Financial Logic & Leverage
- Each simulator bay pays itself off in under 8 months
- Operating costs are minimal due to automation
- Revenue per bay and margin profile improves with scale
- Confirmed expansion does **not** require new headcount

### 7. Risk Management
- Forecasts do **not** assume Better Golf partnership revenue (treated as upside)
- Growth tied to confirmed installs only
- Modular installs keep capex predictable and low-risk

### 8. Strategic Summary
- Clubhouse grows by scaling **software**, not staffing
- All expansion channels are active or already in motion
- ClubOS is not bolted on — it *is* the system
- Our team, our customers, and our systems all operate within a single integrated framework

**Quote for business plan tone**:
"We don’t scale headcount. We scale software. ClubOS lets us grow locations, partner installs, and third-party support without hiring. It’s not an add-on. It’s the core."
