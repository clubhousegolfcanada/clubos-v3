# Claude Prompt â€“ Full Execution Plan

Begin executing the full ClubOS V2 plan from Phase 1 through completion.

ðŸ“„ System Plan:
`/Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse OS (Root)/CLUBOSV2/Notes/Clubhouse OS V2 Plan.md`

ðŸ“‚ Working Directory:
`/Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse OS (Root)/CLUBOSV2/`

ðŸŽ¯ Instructions:
- Start at Phase 1 and work through each section
- Log each completed action to `/Logs/build.log`
- If interrupted, scan `build.log` to resume exactly where left off
- Skip any already completed scaffolding, file creation, or assistant updates
- Only pause for external requirements (e.g., missing secrets, infra access, environment auth)

Do not re-ask questions. Do not regenerate full files unless specifically told to.

âœ… Build autonomously and modularly.
