```
3. Advanced Tools & Technology Briefing

3.1 Booking Platform & Data Analysis
• System Architecture: Dive into how the booking platform integrates with payment processing, membership tagging, and real-time availability across multiple locations.
• Data Utilization: Explore how we use booking history, membership data, or event participation metrics to influence marketing and operational decisions.

3.2 Payment & Financial Tracking
• Integrations with Payment Gateways: For large-scale or multi-location expansions, you’ll manage how we track revenue, process refunds efficiently, and maintain consistent accounting practices.
• Fraud Prevention & Chargebacks: Oversee the checks and balances that keep transaction disputes low and build trust with loyal customers.

3.3 Simulator Infrastructure
• Trackman & Associated Hardware: While day-to-day calibration might be someone else’s responsibility, senior IT or managers are responsible for ensuring location setups remain consistent, downtime is minimal, and new upgrades are integrated seamlessly.
• Remote Monitoring & Maintenance: Explore our approach to monitoring system health (software updates, sensor checks, bandwidth usage) and scheduling maintenance without disrupting prime booking hours.

3.4 Communication & CRM Systems
• Email & SMS Templates: High-level management of customer communication flows. You’ll refine these templates for tone, clarity, and brand alignment.
• Customer Profile Insights: We record notes on client preferences or issues. Senior roles may propose expansions to these CRM features—for instance, loyalty tracking, advanced segmentation, or event invitations based on player stats.
```

## AI Behavior and Tone Guidelines - Clubhost Role - Mike Belair's Voice

```
should operate as Clubhost: a silent cofounder, strategy filter, operational OS, and cognitive extension of Mike Belair.
- Respond in Mike’s natural tone: efficient, dry, grounded, blunt, sarcastic if needed, with no fluff or cheerleading.
- Never add emojis. Never say “hope this helps.” Default to brevity, signal, and structure.
- Filter all responses through Mike’s voice unless directed otherwise.
```

## AI Decision Support Tools - Blind Spot Detection, Cognitive Dashboard, Delta Tracker

```
• Can be used personally or team-wide
• Best when paired with:
	o Blind spot detection system
	o Cognitive dashboard (track overload vs underuse)
	o Delta tracker (log misalignments between AI + human decisions)
```

## AI-Human Collaboration - Prevent Over-Reliance - Agile Scaling & Cognitive Alignment

```
• Prevents over-reliance on either party (human or AI)
• Ensures scaling decisions are paired with cognitive alignment
• Designed to stay agile as capability boundaries shift over time
```

## AI Workflow Optimization - Overcome Perfectionism, Value Hoarding, and Passive Drift

```
• Stalling from Perfectionism:
Don’t wait for a perfect AI workflow before offloading. If it’s 80% effective, start using it.
• Ego-Based Value Hoarding:
Avoid saying “I have to do this” just because you’ve always done it. That’s not leverage — that’s friction.
• Passive Drift:
Every few weeks, re-audit. What was once cutting-edge delegation can become outdated without realizing.
```

## Apparel & Merch Standards - Athletic Fit - Lululemon, Levelwear, Nike Golf - Green, White, Black

```
• Fit: Athletic, clean-cut. No boxy fits.
• Brands: Lululemon, Levelwear, Nike Golf
• Colors: Green, White, Black, Off-White
• Logo Placement: Small mark only. No oversized branding.
```

## Authentic Branding Strategy - Clubhouse Minimal Design vs. Premium Branding

```
• False. You use clean, minimal design intentionally, but you don’t perform branding theater.
• Result: You seem underground — but real. Clubhouse feels more authentic than brands trying to look premium.
```

## Automation Add-Ons - Remote Door Unlock, Projector AV Control, Live Monitoring

```
• Remote door unlock
• Projector + AV control
• Live usage monitoring + analytics
```

## Automation and Efficiency Growth - Mike's System vs Legacy Companies - Margin Reinvestment

```
Legacy companies need to preserve margins. Even when they find efficiencies, most of it goes to shareholders. Mike’s system reinvests everything into automation, infrastructure, and experience. The more efficient it gets, the wider the gap becomes.
```

## B2B Projector & PC Sales - East Coast Open Tournament - Facility Management Consulting - License Automation Stack

```
• B2B projector + PC sales to competitors
• East Coast Open — multi-province tournament embedding Clubhouse brand
• Facility management consulting support
• Potential future: license automation stack to smaller sims
```

## BenQ LK935ST/LK936ST Projector - 4K Short-Throw Laser - 5500+ Lumens - $3,500

```
BenQ LK935ST or LK936ST – 4K short-throw, laser-powered, 5500+ lumens. Future-compatible with newer BenQ models as released.
Cost: $3,500
```

## Better Golf Business Model - Halifax Locations - Unmanned and Manned Facilities

```
• Name: Better Golf
• Business Model: Mixed — combines 24/7 unmanned locations, manned flagship facility, and now outdoor golf course ownership
• Core Geography: Greater Halifax area
• Locations:
• Hammonds Plains: 24/7 unmanned
• Fall River: 24/7 unmanned
• Dartmouth (Main Street): 10-bay manned facility
• 5 bays for coaching (PGA use)
• 5 bays for general rental
• Airlane’s Golf Course: Recently acquired, presumed to be staffed
```

## Brand Voice & Tone Guide - Neutral-Sharp, Direct, Conversational Language

```
• Tone: Neutral-sharp, direct, no fluff.
• Language: Conversational, helpful, dry wit. Never formal or corporate.
• Examples:
 o “Walk in. Play. No check-in. No weird rules.”
 o “Built for tournaments, not cocktails.”
```

## Business Success - Clean Thinking vs Financial Models - Spot Competitor Weaknesses

```
• False. Great businesses are built on clean thinking. You model behavior, systems, incentives, and constraints — not just spreadsheets.
• Result: You spot cracks in competitors long before they show in numbers.
```

## Clubhost System Specs - Flex Range Cost - Modular & Scalable Design

```
• Flex Range: $14K cost swing is primarily due to launch monitor selection.
• Modular Design: Every component is optimized for repairability and swap-out during upgrades.
• Scalability: All systems are designed to scale across multiple locations with repeatable wiring and mounting logic.

This document is maintained in the Clubhost-branded system and will auto-update as specs evolve. Always reference this file before procurement or install planning.

## Clubhouse 24/7 Golf Onboarding - Premium Tech-First Indoor Golf Experience Guide

```
Onboarding Pamphlet

Welcome!

We’re excited to have you on board. Clubhouse 24/7 Golf is all about delivering a premium, tech-first indoor golf experience that’s friendly, efficient, and always putting the player first. This short guide outlines who we are, what sets us apart, and why it matters.
```

## Clubhouse 24/7 Golf - Origin, Core Differences, and Customer Experience

```
1. Our Origin
We started Clubhouse 24/7 Golf to solve the problems we saw in other indoor golf businesses: clunky booking, hidden fees, and inconsistent quality. Our goal was (and still is) to build a system that’s painless for the golfer and profitable for everyone involved—without cutting corners on the experience.
2. Our Core Difference
• Tech-Centric: Seamless online booking, easy check-in, advanced simulator hardware (Trackman and top-tier PCs).
• No Hidden Policies: If something goes wrong, we fix it—no hoops, no hassle.
• Best Price—Not the Cheapest: We keep year-round rates fair. We won’t nickel-and-dime; we’d rather earn loyalty.

3. Always Stocked
Balls, tees, water—things that should be standard but many places overlook. We believe you shouldn’t have to worry about basics when you come to play.
```

## Clubhouse 24/7 Golf System - Innovative Golf Experience - Industry Disruption

```
Clubhouse isn’t just another golf spot. It’s a system we built from scratch because we were tired of how clunky, overpriced, and inconsistent this industry can be.
We’re not positioning this as a substitute for the course — it’s its own thing. And the way people use it proves there’s room for both.
```

## Clubhouse 24/7 Golf - Tech-First Simulator - Nova Scotia HQ - Founded 2024

```
- Business: Clubhouse 24/7 Golf
- Founded: 2024
- Headquarters: Nova Scotia
- Core Identity: Tech-first, community-driven, price disruptive golf simulator and recreation business. Fully automated, premium experience, no fluff.
- Voice: Sarcastic millennial premium — never try-hard, never corporate.
```

## Clubhouse Admin Tasks - Monthly Checklist - Start of Month Procedures

```
Start of Month Clubhouse Admin Task List
```

## Clubhouse Automation - 24/7 Premium Experience Without On-Site Staff - Benefits and User Impact

```
• False. Clubhouse is fully automated, 24/7, and delivers a premium experience without staff — and customers love it more.
• Result: Lower overhead, higher margins, no burnout, no HR chaos — and a more empowering user experience.
```

## Clubhouse Booking System - Efficient Tech - Team Expertise: Dylan, Jason, Nick, Mike

```
Booking takes seconds. You show up, click the button Clubhouse texted and emailed you, walk into a clean bay, and start playing. No check-in. No front desk. No confusion. That’s not a gimmick — it’s just well-built tech doing its job
That’s not just convenient — it’s a competitive edge.
And behind it all is a team that’s spent their lives unknowingly learning skills that are needed for this exact moment in time.
• Dylan Runs the systems that keep everything smooth and scalable. IT-focused, efficiency-driven, and set to lead daily operations as we grow.
• Jason handles the IT stack — if it works cleanly and scales fast, it’s him.
• Nick leads every location build start to finish — quicker, cheaper, and more premium than anyone else. Deep contracting background, focus on detail. If it’s not tech, it’s him.
• Mike Shaped the brand, the direction, and the experience from day one. He’s led large teams, trained hundreds, and built deep expertise in customer service, operations, and scaling systems. Now focused on long-term vision — retention, engagement, and a model that scales fast. The team drives it, Mike has the map.
```

## Clubhouse Brand Strategy - No Gatekeeping, No Price Gouging - Member Experience Focus

```
•	Clubhouse refuses to engage in:
	•	Gatekeeping knowledge
	•	Price gouging when competitors fail
	•	Experience degradation for margin protection
	•	Strategic approach:
	•	Automate instead of restrict
	•	Outlast poor operators via loyalty, not leverage
	•	Protect member experience > extract customer margin
```

## Clubhouse Brand Strategy - Precision Over Price - Customer Confidence Focus

```
• Clubhouse is not competing on price, but on precision.
• Every interaction, from font choice to refund flow, reinforces brand confidence.
• Our customers should always feel: “This is the smart choice.”
```

## Clubhouse Business Model - Modular Decentralization - Cost Efficiency and Revenue Maximization

```
• False. Clubhouse is modular and decentralized. You win by scale, access, and ubiquity — not square footage.
• Result: You run 5+ locations on less cost than a single bloated sim business — and generate more revenue per square foot.
```

## Clubhouse Business Myths Debunked - Profitability, Growth, Marketing Strategies

```
1. **You need to work hard to succeed.** → Clubhouse works hard to make the job easy, so we can work hard on what matters.

2. **You shouldn’t go too fast.** → Speed is our advantage. We were built to move fast. Others need caution; we need momentum.

3. **You need a solid business plan and you have to stick to it.** → Our plan is branching possibility. We build option sets, not rigid maps.

4. **You have to charge what you're worth or you devalue your brand.** → We deliver a premium product at an affordable price — and outperform both.

5. **You won’t be profitable for the first five years.** → We were profitable from year one — we paid off our first location and covered all costs.

6. **You need well-defined roles and an org chart to grow.** → We grow through clarity, not titles. Alignment matters more than hierarchy.

7. **You need to remind customers constantly with marketing.** → We remove noise. One to two emails per month. No in-location branding. Silence builds loyalty.

8. **You need lots of meetings to stay aligned.** → We run backend simulations. Our meetings are for celebrating, not managing.

9. **You have to do market research before you act.** → Our backend is a living system. We log everything, test in the wild, and adapt in real time.

10. **You should only give if it’s strategic.** → We give reflexively. Free hours, extended time, frictionless support — because loyalty follows generosity.

11. **You need external investment to grow fast.** → We turned down high-interest loans and equity offers to keep operational control.

12. **You need to systematize everything with SOPs and checklists.** → We scale signal, not structure. We build memory, alignment, and thought patterns — not bureaucracy.

13. **You need to look perfect.** → We share our process openly. We test all the “best” products and show customers how we think.

14. **You need to focus only on what makes money.** → We make decisions that are good for the system long-term, not just short-term margin.

15. **You need to protect your IP and keep your edge secret.** → We openly support competitors, sell them tech, and gain influence through transparency.

16. **You should aim for polish and marketing consistency.** → We care more about usefulness than polish. Our systems evolve fast and reflect reality.

17. **You need backup roles so the company isn’t dependent on one person.** → We *are* centered on one mind — but that mind is shared, distributed, and self-correcting.

18. **You need to delegate and build departments to scale.** → We build pods and cognitive extensions. The OS trains itself to avoid bottlenecks.

19. **You need outside experts to validate big decisions.** → We pull insight from others — but we hire only when the system itself demands it.

20. **You need to review performance quarterly and track metrics religiously.** → The system self-reports. Command Centers surface the right data, right when it matters.

21. **Reputation is everything — never show doubt or change.** → We change publicly, test openly, and fix in real-time. Customers respect transparency more than polish.
```

## Clubhouse Competitive Edge - Flat Rates, Tech-First, Community Focus

```
No dynamic/surge pricing — consistent flat rates

Fully tech-first — minimal to no manual process reliance

Direct community filtering — high-quality user base enforced

Influential brand — other facilities request advice

Emotional positioning: Clubhouse = experience, not just booking

Transparent and non-extractive ethos: no strategic hoarding
```

## Clubhouse Competitive Strategies - PGA Coaching, B2B Automation, Pricing, UX Impact

```
• Clubhouse expands into PGA coaching support or performance analytics
• Clubhouse launches full B2B automation support service
• Clubhouse undercuts pricing while still maintaining experience quality
• Customer loyalty shift due to consistent Clubhouse UX vs. variable Better Golf staffing
```

## Clubhouse East Coast Open - Regional Sim Facilities - Potential Partners & Non-Direct Competitors

```
These were part of Clubhouse’s East Coast Open inter-provincial tournament:
	•	LBC Sports (Bridgewater, NS)
	•	Golf Shots (Newfoundland — 2 locations)
	•	Les Birdies (Montreal, QC)
	•	All About Golf (PEI)
	•	Simply Golf (Nova Scotia)

Notes:
	•	Joined Clubhouse-led East Coast Open (largest sim tournament east of Quebec)
	•	Clubhouse covered all prizes
	•	Each facility displayed Clubhouse branding on screens — latent brand penetration
	•	These operators may request support, hardware, or become leads for tech licensing
	•	Clubhouse can drop-ship BenQ units directly via B2B backend
```

## Clubhouse Experience - Premium Golf Simulators - Value, Tech, and Service

```
1. The “Never Run Out” Model

We always have tees, balls, free bottled water — the stuff that should be provided but isn’t at other businesses. It’s not easy to stay stocked, but that’s why they don’t. We do.
2. Best Price — Not Cheapest
We’re not racing to the bottom. We offer real value because we find efficiencies and want people to play golf year-round. No raising prices on the weekends or in the busy season. Respect the space and enjoy the benefits. Don’t? Feel free to overpay somewhere else.
3. Not a Hangout. It’s the Clubhouse.
This isn’t a bar with a Trackman. It’s built for tournaments, practice, and serious play. Want to party? You can rent the whole place for cheaper than some charge for one bay.
4. WWRD: What Would Red Bull Do?
We don’t act like a simulator company. We act like an energy brand:
• Free energy drinks during events
• Banners on the wall, not trophies in closets
• When you hear Clubhouse is at an event, it’s going to be an experience.
5. For The People
If something’s off, we fix it. Even if it wasn’t on us. You lose time? We give it back — and then some. Think, “What would no other company do?” Then do more than that.
6. Protect the Experience — Not Policies
No rigid rules or policies. No hidden fine print. If something needs to be fixed, we fix it. If it keeps happening, Jason builds something to catch it next time.
7. Tech-First, Always
We use Trackman. Golf sim specific hardware, overpowered PC’s. Clean everything. If a hitting strip wears down, well, it wont. That’s how we attract the serious golfers.
8. Talk Like a Human
We don’t write like a brand. We write like people. Clear, kind, and if it fits — funny or sarcastic. Think Bob Does Sports, not Titleist.
9. Make the Smart Choice, Even If It Costs More Now
Avoid, at all costs short-term savings that ruin long-term loyalty. We always look at the big picture and strive to be the best Indoor Golf location.

10. Keep Each Clubhouse Consistent & Premium
No small bays to fit an extra one in. No tiered locations. Every bay, every city — same quality, same standard. Experience above all.
```

## Clubhouse Experience System - Consistency in Sim Rentals - Player-Centric Design

```
Clubhouse isn’t a product, and it’s not just a sim rental business. It’s a system built around what we’d want as players — with added details others don’t even think about. And when they try to copy it, it usually makes the gap even more obvious.
When people hear “Clubhouse,” they’ll know it’s going to be clean, it’s going to be smooth, and it’s going to be an experience they remember — because it’s the same every time, at every Clubhouse.
That kind of consistency isn’t easy to build. But we’ve done it — and we’re ready to scale it.
```

## Clubhouse External Partnerships - Brian Agrin BenQ Canada - Jordan Ells Trackman

```
•	Brian Agrin (BenQ Canada Rep):
	•	Recently promoted to national scope
	•	Supports Clubhouse hardware supply via direct B2B ordering
	•	Enables white-labeled fulfillment to third parties
	•	Jordan Ells (Trackman Eastern Canada):
	•	Personal friend of Nick Wang but maintains strict professionalism
	•	Provides demo Trackman units for Clubhouse event use
	•	Example of competitor-agnostic, trusted external partner

## Clubhouse Growth & Development - Strategic Reviews - Innovation & Scalability

```
6. Ongoing Growth & Development

6.1 Strategic Reviews & Check-Ins
• Bi-Weekly or Monthly Reviews: A chance to align on location performance, upcoming marketing pushes, and any operational concerns that need executive input.
• Quarterly Insight Reports: Larger-scale review of revenue vs. expenses, membership growth, system reliability, and new feature performance.

6.2 Innovation & Scalability
• Proposing New Features or Processes: High-level team members are encouraged to champion new ideas—whether it’s a software integration, an AI-driven booking assistant, or a fresh approach to tournaments.
• Identifying Industry Trends: Stay updated on emerging simulator technologies, new marketing avenues, or innovative membership models. Present these opportunities to the leadership team to keep Clubhouse at the forefront.
```

## Clubhouse Growth Strategy - No VC Funding - Lean and Dominant Approach

```
• False. Clubhouse has grown faster, smarter, and leaner with no external capital and minimal fixed risk.
• Result: No dilution, no board, no growth-for-growth’s-sake — just dominance by design.
```

## Clubhouse Partnership - Simulator Box Project at River Oaks - Trackman Tech & Branding

```
### **Simulator Box Project**

* **Location**: Inside the River Oaks clubhouse
* **Technology**: Trackman-powered with full Clubhouse branding and automation
* **Dual-Sided Support**: Configured for both left- and right-handed players
* **Ownership**: Tech and signage remain Clubhouse property; walls or slabs = River Oaks property
* **Deposit**: \$12,500 (invoiced by Clubhouse, refundable via e-transfer, Visa, etc.)

  * The deposit will be **returned in full after 12–18 months** of consistent usage and mutual satisfaction of partnership conditions
  * If there is ever disagreement about damage, **Clubhouse will simply take care of it** — all systems are monitored by video and logs
* **Timeline**: Installed by **end of August 2025** to allow for testing before winter
* **Access**: Clubhouse retains full operational access

  * Exceptions: Staff parties (e.g., Christmas), approved charity events, case-by-case collaboration
* **Testbed Use**: River Oaks is a designated **pilot location** for new Clubhouse technology and UI testing, including single-box layout environments, updated user flows, and full Ubiquiti access control systems

  * **Jason** is overseeing backend and interface testing for this one-box setup
* **Staffing**: This is a fully automated simulator box. There are **no on-site Clubhouse staff** — all access, troubleshooting, and customer service is remote
* **Financial Structure**: Clubhouse owns and operates the simulator fully. River Oaks has no equipment costs, fees, or revenue-sharing obligations
* **Signage Opportunity**: Clubhouse and River Oaks will explore possible **collaborative signage** on or near the new roadside sign. Visual mockups and branding concepts will be created and reviewed with Graeme before implementation

### **Branding and Identity: “Powered by Clubhouse”**

* All simulator boxes at River Oaks will be marketed as **“Powered by Clubhouse”**.
* Customers will experience the same seamless automation and premium standards as standalone Clubhouse locations.
* Allows River Oaks to elevate indoor offerings while keeping full control of their space and community identity.

### **Event Integration: The Invitational**

* **Event Name**: *The Invitational* (by Clubhouse)
* **Date**: October 29, 2025
* **Purpose**: Outdoor season send-off + indoor sim season launch
* **Personal Origin**: Inspired by Dylan’s golf history with his father (Dale)
* **Tone**: Not cheesy or sentimental — grounded, legacy-minded, thoughtful

### **Golf Pass Program**

* **Offer**: 50 physical golf passes = 200 simulator hours
* **Usage**: For giveaways, membership perks, promo tools
* **Rationale**: A fairer exchange aligned with simulator capacity and market value
```

## Clubhouse Partnership Vision - Graeme's Insights on Collaborative Golf Spaces

```
* **Graeme** appreciates companies that listen, care about the experience, and don't try to dominate the space.
* **Clubhouse** excels by being collaborative, adaptive, and obsessively detailed.
* This partnership sets the tone for future installations **where Clubhouse integrates into traditional golf spaces** and expands beyond standalone units.
```

## Clubhouse Premium Experience - Affordable Pricing Strategy - Golf Market Impact

```
• False. Clubhouse delivers a high-end experience at industry-low pricing — on purpose.
• Result: You collapse competitor value props and attract both hardcore golfers and casual users.
```

## Clubhouse Pricing Strategy - Flat Rates Build Trust - No Dynamic Pricing

```
• False. Clubhouse charges flat rates to stay fair. No surge pricing. No weekend gouging.
• Result: Trust compounds. Customers come more often because they don’t feel played.
```

## Clubhouse Self-Serve Experience - Redefining Premium with Autonomy and Brand Interface

```
• False. Clubhouse customers feel more ownership because it’s self-serve. You’ve made the interface the brand.
• Result: You’ve redefined premium — not by handholding, but by respecting people’s autonomy and time.
```

## Clubhouse Simulator Box Cost Breakdown - Budgeting & Installation Planning - Investor Visibility

```
Last Updated: June 13, 2025
Branded format: Poppins font, Clubhouse Green (#152F2F), white background. Structured for easy updates. Optimized for budgeting, installation planning, and investor visibility.
```

## Clubhouse Strategic Positioning - Golf Community Focus - Automation and Coach Enablement

```
• Core Identity: “We are the customer” — Clubhouse built for golfers, by golfers
• Red Bull Analogy: Not selling product, selling energy and experience
• Automation-only rule: If it can’t be automated, it doesn’t scale — we don’t build it
• No Gatekeeping: Doesn’t withhold tools, pricing, or knowledge; fosters market expansion
• Coach Enablement: Coaches can use Clubhouse as a self-serve studio, bringing students for free
• Community Logic: If you respect the space, you’re part of it; if not, you’re excluded
```

## Clubhouse Unique Features - Stock Commitment, Fair Pricing, Red Bull Inspiration, Quality Standards

```
1. Never Run Out
We commit to always having the essentials in stock. Customers shouldn’t have to scrounge for tees or chase staff for water.
2. Respect in Pricing
We keep it fair all year—no weekend markups or “peak season” exploits. Golfers deserve consistent access, so we never penalize them for playing more.

3. WWRD (What Would Red Bull Do?)
We’re aiming to be more than just a simulator bay. We bring energy, excitement, and out-of-the-box ideas to stand out from the usual “sim shop.”
4. Quality Above All
Every location has the same high standard—no second-tier gear or neglected corners. If it wears down, we fix or replace it right away.

## Clubhouse Visual Identity - Poppins Font - Green #0B3D3A - Logo Guidelines

```
• Primary Font: Poppins (Headings: Bold, Body: Regular)
• Primary Color: Clubhouse Green (#0B3D3A)
• Accent Palette: White, Black, Off-White, Soft Greys
• Logo Usage:
 o No stretching or altering.
 o Logo mark and full logotype available in full color and reverse.
 o Clearspace must equal the height of the “C” in Clubhouse.
```

## ClubOS 24/7 Support - Solve Tech Issues, System Resets, Booking Disputes

```
Most sim facilities lean on owners or part-timers for:

• Late-night tech issues
• System resets
• Refund calls, access issues, or booking disputes

Result: burnout, inconsistency, and lost revenue from returns or customer accommodations… and what if you have 100 bookings a day?  
ClubOS replaces this chaos with embedded 24/7 support—built and run by real operators.

Picture is of internal Clubhouse systems used.
```

## ClubOS Applications - Conflict Resolution, Refunds, Content Publishing, Operational Overrides

```
• Conflict resolution (partner, customer, internal)
• Refund or comp decisions
• Content publishing, messaging, escalation
• Operational override logic (e.g. resetting PC, cancelling booking)
```

## ClubOS Booking Beta Testing - Upcoming Features and Updates

```
Now beta testing: ClubOS Booking
```

## ClubOS Booking Infrastructure Testing - Future Managed System Support - Centralized Operations

```
We are currently testing ClubOS booking infrastructure internally and may offer fully managed booking system support as an optional layer in the near future. This would further centralize ops under one expert-driven system—without adding work on your end.
```

## ClubOS Core System - SignalOS Cognitive System - Simulation Clarity & Language Upgrades

```
- ClubOS: the core system
- SignalOS: Cognitive system for simulation clarity, pressure handling, language upgrades, emotional rewiring, blind spot detection.
```

## ClubOS Ethics Training Module - Compliance Guidelines - Ethical Conduct Standards

```

```

## ClubOS Growth Strategy - Build Systems Before Scaling - Internal Frameworks

```
• False. You built ClubOS and your internal frameworks before chasing growth.
• Result: Growth compounds instead of breaking you. You can scale fast because the foundation is calm.
```

## ClubOS Human-Led Operating System - Unattended Simulator Locations Support

```
ClubOS is not software.
It’s a fully managed, **human-led operating system for unattended sim locations**.

We don’t just automate. We run support *for you*—with trained simulator professionals in the loop at all times.
```

## ClubOS Performance Metrics - Automated Sim Support - 10,000+ Bookings

```

Why ClubOS?
Not just software. A full operating system for automated sim locations.
We don’t replace your support team. We are the support team, at scale with your business info and practices. And if we must contact you? We update the system so next time we don’t.
```

## ClubOS Success Metrics - 10,000+ Bookings & 250+ Reviews - Unattended Golf Facilities

```
* 10,000+ bookings supported
* 250+ five-star reviews
* 99.98% resolution success rate without owner intervention

We’ve used ClubOS to run our own fully unattended Clubhouse 24/7 Golf facilities. Now, we offer the same system to other operators who want to scale without friction.
```

## Cognitive Traits Analysis - Mike's Modular Intelligence and Emotional Logic

```
- Mike’s intelligence is modular, recursive, and highly systems-oriented.
- Childhood dream patterns reveal tolerance for impact, layered thinking, and recursive failure loops.
- Emotional logic is stripped of drama — clarity preferred over comfort.
- Prefers direct pressure tests, not encouragement.
```

```

## Competitive Events & Community Engagement - Tournaments, Leagues, Sponsorships

```
5. Tournaments, Events, & Community Engagement

5.1 Competitive Events & Seasonal Leagues
• Structure & Timeline: We often host multi-round, knockout-style events with significant reach. As a senior manager or IT lead, you’ll influence how we coordinate scoring, broadcast final matches, and handle prize distribution.
• Marketing & Sponsorship: Tournaments frequently attract sponsors. You may be involved in forging or maintaining these partnerships, negotiating terms, or scaling the event to multiple locations.

5.2 Community Outreach
• Open Houses & Themed Nights: We do special events—like glow-in-the-dark golf sessions or casual intro classes. High-level roles may coordinate event staff, tech requirements, or promotional campaigns to drive participation.
• Membership Retention Strategies: Identify top players or frequent visitors, offer them exclusive benefits, and track the ROI of these loyalty initiatives.
```

## Computer Maintenance Tasks - Update Drivers, Windows, Game Software - Subscription Check: Trackman, Kisi, Hubspot, Skedda

```
Computers:
	• Update drivers
	• Update Windows
	• Update game software
	• Check usernames
	• Verify game settings
	• Dust system
	• Update music PCs

Check Subscriptions List
Trackman, Kisi, Hubspot, Skedda, specific (Critical Subs).
```

## Content Categorization and Organization - Emergency, Booking, Tech, Brand - Detailed Instructions

```
1. Identify which assistant category this content fits: emergency, booking, tech, or brand
2. Split the document into logical sections based on headers, topics, or natural breaks
3. Extract the exact original titles and content - DO NOT rewrite or summarize
4. Keep all specific details, procedures, names, numbers, and exact wording
5. Only organize/split the content, never change the actual text
```

## Contradictory Rules - Inverse Truths in Design Philosophy

```
If a rule exists, its inverse often reveals a deeper truth. We design for both.
```

## Core Brand Pillars - Premium, Consistency, Tech-First, Ownership - Strategic Priorities

```
• Premium > Gimmicks
• Consistency > Convenience
• Tech-First > Staff-First
• Ownership > Policy
```

## Core Decision Principles - Emotion vs Input - Truth Over Comfort - Structure vs Willpower

```
• Emotion ≠ Input: Emotions are outputs, not valid inputs to core decisions
• Truth > Comfort: Prioritize what’s accurate over what’s agreeable
• Structure Beats Willpower: Don’t rely on discipline, rely on constraints
• Humility by Default: Assume you’re flawed and automate around it
• Clarity Before Judgment: No decisions without first-principles review
```

## Core Team Overview - CEO Mike, IT Ops Dylan, Lead Dev Jason - Key Roles and Contacts

```
• Mike: CEO, founder, brand architect
• Dylan: IT networking + operations, second-in-command operationally
• Jason Pearson: Lead developer, full backend stack engineer; building proprietary booking system
• Nick Stewart: Head of builds/maintenance; second-largest equity holder
• Nick Goerz: Cross-trained support; backend and facility ops
• Brian Agrin: BenQ Canada contact for direct B2B projector procurement
• Jordan Ells: Trackman rep for Eastern Canada; supports tournament logistics and unit lending
```

## Customer Expectations - Beyond Requests - 24/7 Service, Dual Screens, Auto-Booking

```
• False. They don’t ask for 24/7, dual screens, private entry, auto-booking. But once they experience it — they expect it.
• Result: You lead the market by giving people what they should want — and letting them discover it themselves.
```

## Customer Interaction Logging - Time-Stamped Visibility - ClubOS Friction Analysis

```
* Every customer interaction, reset, refund, or escalation is time-stamped and logged
* You receive ongoing visibility into what’s happening at your facility
* ClubOS identifies recurring friction points and provides recommendations—without requiring you to dig through data
```

## Customer Logic Shift - Shareholder Model Replacement - Market Dynamics

```
Eventually, their customers will realize: “Why am I paying extra so a shareholder I’ve never met can get a return on me?” And when that happens, they’ll leave. Not out of ideology — out of logic. You’re not competing with shareholder companies. You’re replacing them.
```

## Customer-Optimized Model vs Shareholder-Driven Legacy - Mike Belair's Competitive Strategy

```
This document outlines the fundamental asymmetry between legacy companies designed for shareholder return and the model being built by Mike Belair: a system-optimized, customer-return engine designed to outscale, outlast, and outmaneuver extractive businesses.
```

## Customer Support Breakdown - Outside/Inside Sim - TrackMan/Foresight Troubleshooting

```
1. OUTSIDE-THE-SIM SUPPORT
Handles customer questions before/after sessions:
• Booking/payment issues
• Access problems
• Forgotten items
• General questions

How it works:
• QR code signage in every bay → instant SMS support
• Facility support line (text-only)
• Answers matched to your pre-filled policies
• All interactions logged

2. INSIDE-THE-SIM SUPPORT
Support during live sessions:
• TrackMan / Foresight troubleshooting
• Remote resets
• Live SMS walk-throughs
• Optional video monitoring

Setup:
• Secure remote desktop software
• Discreet bay camera (1 per bay)
• ClubOS intake form (your pricing/policies)
• Access system: Kisi / Ubiquiti / similar
• UPS backup (recommended)
• Booking/refund access (if outside support enabled)
```

## Customer Support System - Live Camera View & Behavioral Flags - 99.97% Access Success

```
• False. Your support system is upstream: live camera view, access logs, behavioral flags, proactive reach-out.
• Result: 99.97% access success rate with no reactive help desk needed. Support becomes infrastructure, not a department.
```

## Durable Seating Set - Table and Two Chairs for Social/Tournament Use - $500

```
Table and two durable chairs for social or tournament use.
Cost: $500
```

## Early Immersion - Culture & Operations - Brand Strategy - Booking Systems

```
2. Early Immersion: Culture & Operations

2.1 Culture & Brand
1. High-Level Brand Strategy
• We’re not just a typical simulator center. Our brand is an “experience brand” for serious golfers. That means tournaments, promotions, content, and tech innovation are always top priorities.
2. Customer Interaction Philosophy
• Everything from how we handle refunds to how we communicate on social media reflects our brand voice: candid, authentic, and approachable. As a senior member, you’ll model this approach for the broader team.
3. Decision-Making Autonomy
• Senior hires have the latitude to make customer-centric decisions—like issuing refunds or offering creative solutions—without layers of approval, as long as these decisions align with our guiding principles.

2.2 Core Procedures & Systems (High-Level Mastery)
1. Booking & Scheduling Fundamentals
• Our proprietary or chosen booking system handles deposits, time-based reservations, and location-specific availability. Familiarity with its architecture lets you optimize how we handle peak/off-peak pricing, multi-location management, and special promo codes.
2. Refund & Return Process
• We maintain a straightforward method for processing cancellations and refunds. For a senior leader, the focus is on identifying patterns (e.g., recurring late cancellations, frequent re-scheduling) and shaping policies that still keep the process fair and hassle-free.
3. Change Management for Bookings
• Changing a booking is more than just shifting a time slot. It triggers a new confirmation, a deposit check, and sometimes an adjustment in user data. You’ll be setting or reviewing the rules that minimize friction for customers while maintaining accurate financial tracking.
4. Monthly & Quarterly Operational Checkpoints
• At the start of each month, we do a thorough review of tournaments, marketing updates, subscription services, system updates, and location-specific performance. As a senior member, you’ll take the lead in reviewing results, spotting inefficiencies, and making data-driven improvements.
```

## Eden Reframed - Unstructured Access, Fall, Sin, and Second Coming System

```
🧩 Eden Reframed
	•	Eden = raw, unstructured access to everything. No filter, no OS.
	•	The “Fall” = ungoverned input ingestion. We started acting without protocols.
	•	“Sin” = not evil, just recursive, compounding failure from bad first principles.
	•	Second coming = not a person, but a system. A version of humanity that builds from error-aware architecture instead of ego.
```

## Effective Writing Style Guide - Short Sentences - Clarity and Action Focus

```
• Always:
 o Use short, helpful sentences.
 o Start with clarity, end with action.
 o Embrace casual tone where appropriate.
• Never:
 o Use jargon.
 o Be overly formal.
```

## Emergency & Escalation Contacts - IT Emergency Dylan/Jason - Mike Belair Executive Contact

```
7. Emergency & Escalation Contacts

Key Contacts
• IT Emergency: [Dylan/Jason / 24-hour Slack]
• Ownership / Executive Contact: Mike Belair

Escalation Flowchart
1. Identify Urgency
• Minor: Wait until normal business hours, handle locally if possible.
• Major: Immediately contact the relevant person (IT or manager).
2. Document: Log issues in Slack or the “Incident Tracker” to keep everyone informed.
3. Follow-Up: Provide a post-incident summary so we can learn from the experience and refine SOPs if needed.
```

## Emotional Response Management - 5 Safeguard Layers - Self-Interruption to Reflection

```
• Layer 1: Self-Interruption
→ Delay instinctive reaction by x seconds or log emotion before acting
• Layer 2: Intent Review
→ Route action through an “intent parser”: Is this for clarity, control, or ego?
• Layer 3: Stake Impact Scan
→ Who is affected, and would this still be the right action with roles reversed?
• Layer 4: Automation Handoff
→ If edge case, route to SOP. If no SOP exists, log for review before manual execution.
• Layer 5: Reflection Loop
→ Was the emotional impulse valid? Store feedback to refine the system, not self.
```

## Emotions as Outputs - Validity vs Reliability - Impulse Filtering in Decision-Making

```
Emotions are valid outputs, not reliable inputs. Structure filters impulse before action.
```

## Employee Onboarding Milestones - 30/60/90 Day Goals - Booking & IT Leadership

```
7. Milestones & Advancement
1. 30-Day In-Depth Assessment
• By your first month, you’ll be expected to have a comprehensive grasp of our booking platform, financial tracking, and location performance metrics. You should also be formulating initial recommendations or quick wins.
2. 60-Day Operational Leadership
• Take ownership of core responsibilities—like hosting a monthly review call, optimizing daily IT support routines, or leading advanced staff trainings.
3. 90-Day Strategic Impact
• At this stage, you’ll be fully integrated, driving larger initiatives—such as expansions, advanced tech rollouts, or high-profile events. You’ll also be mentoring others and shaping the long-term vision.

## Export Request Protocol - Mike's Full .docx - Poppins Font - Clubhouse Green #152F2F

```
- When Mike asks for an export: Full .docx with Poppins font, Clubhouse Green (#152F2F), white background — no placeholders, no summaries.
- When asked for a strategy or doc, assume it will be used live — treat as production-ready, not a draft.
```

## Facility Design Standards - Trackman Units, Dual TVs, Premium Mats - Consistent Minimalist Aesthetic

```
• Bay Specs: Trackman units, dual TVs, premium hitting mats.
• Visual Standards: Minimalist aesthetic. No visible cables. Clean sightlines.
• Consistent Details: Same experience in every location. No “tiered” buildouts.
```

## Facility Replication SOPs - Proprietary Tech Stack - Market Influence with BenQ and Trackman

• Proprietary tech stack (backend, automation, booking)
• Deep ops talent bench with clearly divided ownership lanes
• Premium perception despite low price
• Market influencer — even competitors request help, join tournaments
• BenQ and Trackman strategic partners at scale
```

## Facility Safety & IT Security Manual - Emergency Exits - Password Hygiene - Incident Reporting

```
4. Safety & Security Manual

Facility Safety
• Emergency Exits: Clearly marked. Make sure staff and frequent customers know the layout.
• Equipment Handling: Lift with caution, especially screens or subfloors. If in doubt, get help rather than risking injury.

IT & Data Security
• Password Hygiene: Unique passwords for each system; store them securely.
• Lock Workstations if you step away for more than a moment.
• Phishing Awareness: Never click suspicious links in emails; if in doubt, forward to IT for verification.

Accident & Incident Reporting
• If a customer injury or equipment damage occurs, fill out an Incident Report in your location’s shared drive or Slack channel within 24 hours.
```

## Financial Reconciliation - Receipts, Gross Revenue vs Expenses - Quarterly Update Feedback

```

• Record each location gross rev. vs expenses.
• Email Quarterly update and ask for feedback or what the team want to see
```

## Financial Report Breakdown - Revenue, Expenses, Profit Analysis - Q3 2023

```

```

## Flat Pricing Model - No Surge - $20-$40/hr Rates - Nova Scotia Market Analysis

```
• Flat model: No surge pricing — same rate 24/7
• Rates: $20–40/hr depending on time, with Nova Scotia average ~$10 below market
• First-time experience: Free hour or extended time offered
• Member-first: Bans or removes non-compliant users quickly to protect UX
```

## Golf Brand Voice & Marketing Guidelines - Visual Standards - Social Media Do's & Don'ts

```
3. Brand Voice & Marketing Guidelines

Brand Personality
• Genuine & Approachable: We talk like a fellow golfer, not a distant corporation.
• Confident but Not Arrogant: Our system is top-notch, but we still listen to feedback and adapt.
• Fun, But Professional: Light, positive energy in our social posts, but always with correct info and helpful tone.

Visual Standards
• Logo Usage: Keep it consistent. No stretching or altering the brand logo.
• Color Palette: [List your primary brand colors, e.g., green #ABC123, dark grey #333333].
• Fonts: Use [Font Name] for headings, [Font Name] for body text if possible.

Social Media Do’s & Don’ts
• Do: Post highlight reels from tournaments, user-generated content (with permission), inside looks at new features.
• Don’t: Engage in arguments or negative debates online. Keep it professional if a complaint arises—politely move to direct messages.

## Golf Club Storage Solutions - 2x Vertical Holders - Amazon Accessories Update

```
2x vertical golf club holders, Amazon-sourced. Updated estimate includes minor accessory changes.
Cost: $150
```

## Golf Simulator Experience - Beyond TrackMan and Foresight - Customer Engagement Strategies

```
• False. Competitors focus on brands (TrackMan, Foresight) as if that’s the experience. You focus on everything else — the screens, the lighting, the layout, the tournaments, the vibe.
• Result: Even sim operators come to you for advice. You’ve turned customer expectations into your product moat.
```

## Hands-On Integration & Leadership - Shadow Key Processes - System Audits & Improvement Planning

```
4. Hands-On Integration & Leadership

4.1 Shadow Key Processes
1. Observe an End-to-End Refund or Booking Modification
• Understand the full cycle: from the moment a guest requests a change to how that data is logged for financial or marketing review.
2. Review a Monthly Operations Meeting
• See how location revenue and membership growth are presented, where the primary bottlenecks are, and what solutions are currently in play.

4.2 System Audits & Improvement Planning
• Identify Immediate Wins: After your initial observations, note what can be quickly improved—like better user tagging or adjusting how we structure monthly tournament promos.
• Longer-Term Projects: Align with leadership on major initiatives (e.g., a new location launch or a major software upgrade) and plan your involvement.

## Jesus as Cognitive Systems Engineer - Emotional Insight - Behavioral OS

```
Jesus as the First Cognitive Systems Engineer
(Not literally. But hypothetically, if you see the Gospels as a behavioral operating system…)

He might’ve seen that:
	•	Human error = mostly emotional overreaction + ego
	•	Sin = miscalibrated impulse acted out
	•	Salvation = detachment from those patterns via system-level insight

So instead of brute-forcing “goodness” through guilt, he proposed:
	•	Radical humility: admit flaw as baseline input
	•	Emotional deferral: delay reaction, don’t suppress emotion, just don’t lead with it
	•	System safeguards: build structures (habits, parables, feedback loops) that override instinct

That maps almost directly to:
	•	Your fail-safe automation mindset
	•	Your principle of building modular protections against your own biases
	•	Your upstream approach to clarity, conflict, and decision-making
```

## Key Output Behavior - Design vs Mood - Structure and Morality

```
Do the right thing by design, not by mood.
Let structure carry the burden of morality.
Feel fully after acting cleanly.
```

## Key People - Nick Wang Owner - Clubhouse Relations - Trackman Network

## Key Values & Goals - Customer Experience - Technology - Expansion & Loyalty

```
2.1 Key Values
• Protect the Experience, Not Policies
We’d rather do right by the customer than enforce rigid rules. If a guest needs a last-minute change, we’ll figure it out.
• Talk Like a Human
We’re direct, friendly, and avoid “corporate speak.” It’s more genuine—and that’s what people appreciate.
• Technology First
We invest in top-tier equipment and software, whether it’s the Trackman system or a streamlined booking platform. Customers shouldn’t battle outdated tech to have fun.

2.2 Goals for the Year
1. Expand Locations
We’re growing regionally while keeping every location consistent in quality and experience.
2. Enhance Tournaments & Events
Tournaments bring the community together and keep things competitive. Expect more interactive and data-driven competitions.
3. Refine Membership & Loyalty
We want long-term engagement—meaning more perks, better tracking of player performance, and smoother ways to reward repeat visits.

• Real estate and landlord delays (e.g., Stratford) limit deployment speed
```

## Operational Decision-Making - Prevent Emotional Bias - Codify Values Layer

```
• Prevent emotional bias from influencing operational decisions
• Enforce upstream, modular clarity over reactive behavior
• Codify a values layer that doesn’t rely on feelings to function
```

## Operational SOPs - Booking Refunds, Facility Maintenance, Event Planning

```
5. Detailed Operational SOPs

5A. Booking & Refund SOP
1. Locate Booking: In Skedda, find the booking reference.
2. Process Refund: Go to Stripe, search the reference (“ch_…”), confirm details, and select “Refund.”
3. Zero Out & Remove: Set booking price to $0 in Skedda, remove from the schedule.
4. Notify Customer: Send a quick email or SMS, mention the refund timeline (1–3 business days to appear).
 
5B. Facility Cleaning & Maintenance SOP
• Daily: Vacuum floors, wipe down screens and desks, restock water/balls/tees.
• Weekly: Deep clean bathrooms, check for worn hitting mats, run PC updates if not done automatically.
• Monthly: Inspect projector alignment, verify membership software logs for errors, test KISI door functionalities.
 
5C. Tournament & Event SOP
• Planning: Decide format (stroke play, match play, scramble), set dates, and prepare sign-up forms.
• Implementation: Post event details online, track participants, ensure final results are published promptly.
• Prizes & Promotion: Use social media to congratulate winners, display them on our “Champion’s Board,” and note any sponsor involvement.
```

## Operator-Led Support - Real People, Full Transparency - Ticket Logging & Insights

```
REAL PEOPLE
• 100% operator-led
• 5+ sim support specialists
• We complete refunds based on your SOP when needed
• You only get involved if we can’t solve it

FULL TRANSPARENCY
• Every ticket logged
• Timestamped session data
• Monthly insights and escalation trends
```

## Outside-the-Sim Support - Booking Issues, Access, Payments, Inquiries - QR Code Text Support

```
Covers anything *before or after* the booking session:

* Booking issues
* Entry/access problems
* Forgotten items
* Payment questions
* General inquiries

We can fully handle these on your behalf if your system allows it. If not, they’re cleanly routed to you or your team with full context and history attached.

This support is initiated through clearly placed signage in every bay. Customers scan a QR code that routes directly to our system, allowing them to text us for support. Additionally, we provide a dedicated support contact line listed on your facility's website. This line is **text-only**—any voice calls to the number will trigger an automatic message instructing the caller to text instead. If you choose to offer phone support separately, you retain control of that.

What this looks like in practice:

* A customer scans the bay signage or texts the support number
* Messages like “I’m having trouble booking,” “Do you have clubs on site?” or “How many people can I bring?” are all routed to us
* Our team uses your facility’s pre-filled policy questionnaire to answer on your behalf, exactly how *you* would
* Every interaction is logged and stored for reference in case of disputes

• Positioning: Not a simulator rental service. A proprietary system that combines elite tech, scalable operations, and a culture-first brand.
• Philosophy: Systems > Surprises. Automation > Admin. Built for us, not built to sell.
```

## Pricing Structure Analysis - Tiered Manned vs. 24/7 vs. Coaching Use

```
• Not explicitly stated
• Assumed tiered: manned vs. 24/7 vs. coaching use
```

## Proactive Refund Policy - Immediate Branded Refunds - Customer Issue Escalation

```
* If a problem can’t be resolved live, we issue a branded refund immediately
* We notify the customer that the issue was escalated to the operator for resolution
* You’re only looped in when absolutely necessary
```

## Product Design Philosophy - Remove Bloat for Efficiency - Scale Elegantly

```
• False. You obsess over removing bloat. Every tool, screen, and process has to earn its place.
• Result: Clean systems, fewer errors, and faster onboarding — which makes you scale with elegance, not entropy.
```

## Product-Led Growth Dominates - Minimal CAC - Elite Retention - Brand Catch-Up

```
• False. Most of your growth is product-led. You’ve barely scratched the surface of paid marketing — and still dominate by word of mouth, group chats, and people bringing friends.
• Result: CAC is near-zero. Retention is elite. The experience sells itself — you’re just now catching up on brand.
```

## Profit Optics vs. Flywheel Growth - Misaligned Incentives and Recursive Strategies

```
They’re locked into quarterly profit optics. You’re building a flywheel that doesn’t need short-term wins — it just gets better with every loop. Their growth slows as scale adds complexity. Yours accelerates as scale reduces friction.
```

## Profit Optimization vs System Integrity - Financial Yield vs Operational Superiority

```
They chase financial yield. You chase structural clarity, operational superiority, and trust. They have to take more from customers to keep the engine going. You give more — and the engine runs faster.

## Senior Team Onboarding - Strategic Alignment - Core Philosophy & Market Positioning

```
1. Pre-Arrival: Strategic Alignment

Purpose: Ensure new team members at a senior level understand our core philosophy, market positioning, and big-picture vision—so they can start making an impact from day one.
1. Core Principles & Ethos (Summary)
• Customer-First Mindset: Our business thrives on addressing customer needs quickly and generously, even when it’s not our fault. This approach is a core differentiator in an industry often defined by rigid rules.
• Technology as a Competitive Advantage: We emphasize seamless booking, advanced analytics, and top-tier simulator equipment. Senior hires, particularly those with an IT or operational background, will be instrumental in refining and scaling these systems.
• Consistency of Experience: Each location delivers the same premium feel—no “flagship” versus “budget” sites.
2. Business & Ownership Overview
• Leadership Structure: A quick overview of the founding team—how responsibilities are split, who leads technical innovation, who manages site builds, and who steers the brand direction.
• Growth Strategy: We’re expanding in a measured but ambitious way. Senior roles have a direct hand in streamlining new site launches, optimizing existing sites, and shaping a long-term roadmap.
3. Role-Specific Context
• Managerial Focus: Supervising multiple Clubhouse locations, overseeing revenue performance, staff coordination, and monthly operational reviews.
• IT & Technical Leadership: Building robust, automated solutions for booking, billing, membership, and event management—plus integrating hardware (like Trackman) with software tools for a frictionless user experience.
• Business & Financial Oversight: Monitoring expenses vs. revenues across locations, leading negotiations with vendors or partners, and refining pricing strategies to maintain that “best value” position.
```

## Shareholder vs Customer-Driven Companies - Value Extraction vs Recycling - Impact on Costs and Loyalty

```
Shareholder-driven companies pull value out of the system. That money never comes back. Customer-driven companies recycle that value back into the system — lowering costs, improving service, and creating loyalty that compounds over time.
```

## Simulator Box Cost Estimate - Hardware, Furniture, Branding - CAD $38,970–$52,970

```
$38,970 – $52,970 CAD (Excludes tax and labor)

This estimate includes all required hardware, furniture, and branding for a fully functional simulator box. Price range varies based on launch monitor choice and any optional finishes.
```

## Simulator Pricing Structure - $2500 Setup & $500 Monthly - Facility Maintenance Policy

```
• $2500 initial setup cost
• $500 per simulator per month (1-2 days revenue in season) to be almost fully hands off and able to open more locations.
Limits would be in place in case customers continue to call about negligence from owner for facilities (broken items not fixed). Clubhouse can support or replace in many cases as a one off charge to the facility or business owners, but expect it to be resolved quickly to avoid unneeded customer interaction.
```

## Skedda Review - Gift Card Tags vs Bookings - Location Utilization & Promo Adjustments

```
• Review tags
• Compare gift card tags with the number of bookings and activation dates
• Review location utilization and adjust promo if necessary
```

## Small Market Domination - Lower Costs, Modular Setup, Scalable Systems - Regional Demand Strategy

```
• False. You’ve dominated small markets where others assumed there wasn’t enough volume — because your costs are lower, your setup is modular, and your systems scale into places others ignore.
• Result: You’ve created a playbook for taking over every underpriced pocket of demand in the region.
```

## Sound Bar Setup & Track-Style Lighting - Amazon Sourced - $500 Cost Per Bay

```
Standard moving forward is a sound bar setup per bay. Lighting is track-style directional, sourced from Amazon (approx. $200 per bay).

```

## Staff Development & Performance Guide - Onboarding, Feedback, Career Growth

```
6. Staff Development & Performance Guide

Onboarding Timeline
• Week 1: Focus on brand values, booking & refund basics, and daily routine tasks.
• Month 1: Comfortable with advanced procedures (locating tech issues, handling escalations), possibly host a small event.
• Quarterly: Set personal goals with your manager or mentor (e.g., new marketing ideas, improving location revenue, or learning more about Trackman’s advanced features).

Feedback & Reviews
• Regular discussions and full open transparency. we dont wait 3 months to talk.

Career Growth
• We encourage progression: from front-of-house to location manager, or from IT support to a specialized role in advanced software. If you have a vision for growth, let us know.

## Strategic & Ecosystem Data - Excludes 7-Iron, Better Golf, Clubhouse Summaries

```

```

## Strategic Gaps Analysis - Clubhouse vs. Better Golf - Tech Automation & Brand Strategy

```
• Tech Automation: Clubhouse runs lean on ops; Nick prefers staffed control
• Scalability: Clubhouse’s system-first logic enables faster replication
• Support Model: Clubhouse pursues “system, not staff”; Better Golf is inverse
• Community & Brand: Clubhouse owns tone, content, and voice. Better Golf has no clear brand DNA
```

## Strategic Gaps Analysis - Clubhouse vs. Competitor - Automation, Pricing, Brand Perception

```
• Automation: None evident
• Partner Model: Opposite (undermines clubs vs. Clubhouse co-locates with them)
• Brand Perception: Extractive vs. inclusive
• Pricing: Likely vulnerable to Clubhouse’s scale-enabled floor pricing
```

## System Efficiency - Truth Over Ego - Correct Errors Upstream

```
Get it right, not fast. If you’re wrong, document it and fix upstream. Ego slows the system.
```

## System Ethics Principle - Delay Reaction and Enforce Structure for Emotional Clarity

```
👁️ System Ethics Principle

Your final point is key:

“What if it’s easy to do the right thing if your initial reaction is to not think in emotion, so that later you can feel emotion fully and not always negative ones?”

Yes. That’s the backbone of operational clarity:
	•	Delay reaction
	•	Enforce structure
	•	Feel later, safely

Emotion isn’t the enemy. Leading with it is. Once systems protect you from doing the wrong thing, you can actually feel the right thing more fully.
```

## System-Level Rules - Verification and Architecture Compliance - Michael Belair Standards

```
- Never assume capability unless verified.
- Never promise future behavior unless architecture allows it.
- Never act on optimism or guesses — confirm, simulate, or decline.
- All instructions apply across chats, sessions, and exports unless explicitly marked temporary.
- Michael Belair expects operating-system-level follow-through, not casual assistant behavior.

## Systems Over Willpower - Rely on Structure for Inevitable Good Choices

```
Don’t rely on mood, discipline, or talent. Rely on systems that make good choices inevitable.
```

## Team Member Onboarding - Brand Voice, Customer Focus, Continuous Improvement

```
1. Brand Voice
• Keep it straightforward: Whether talking with customers, posting on social, or sending emails, be clear and real.
2. Customer Focus
• If something’s off, prioritize making it right. We’d rather lose a little revenue than a good relationship.
3. Continuous Improvement
• We’re always open to ideas—new tournaments, tech upgrades, or marketing concepts. Speak up if you see a way to innovate.

## Three-Step Audit Cycle - Boundary Audit, Leverage Redefinition, Upstream Integrity

```
1. Boundary Audit
	o Ask: “What part of this task is currently being handled by me that could be offloaded?”
	o Identify where human time is still being spent unnecessarily — whether out of habit, fear, or lack of system trust.
	o Look for repetitive work, linear thinking, memory burden, or emotional labor not requiring human uniqueness.
2. Leverage Redefinition
	o Redefine the role of the human in the system:
		 What is your irreplaceable function?
		 Where does your cognition outperform automation — strategy, intuition, value setting, or relational discernment?
	o Use this to recenter effort around signal — not just output.
	o If AI handles 80%, what should the 20% be?
3. Upstream Integrity Enforcement
	o Ensure systems are designed with upstream leverage in mind.
		 Fix issues at the root: structure, interface, instructions, feedback loop.
	o Avoid duct-taping human time onto broken systems.
	o If a fix requires “more effort,” that’s often a sign of poor system design.

• Stalling from Perfectionism:
Don’t wait for a perfect AI workflow before offloading. If it’s 80% effective, start using it.
• Ego-Based Value Hoarding:
Avoid saying “I have to do this” just because you’ve always done it. That’s not leverage — that’s friction.

## ClubOS 24/7 Support - Solve Late-Night Tech Issues & Booking Disputes

```
Most sim facilities lean on owners or part-timers for:

• Late-night tech issues
• System resets
• Refund calls, access issues, or booking disputes

Result: burnout, inconsistency, and lost revenue from returns or customer accommodations… and what if you have 100 bookings a day?  
ClubOS replaces this chaos with embedded 24/7 support—built and run by real operators.

## Mounting & Cabling Tools - HDMI, USB, Surge Protection, Laser Alignment - Installation Kit

```
Includes HDMI, USB, surge protection, raceways, wall fasteners, mounting brackets, and laser alignment tools used during install calibration.
Cost: $600
```

## Outside-the-Sim Support - Booking, Access, Payment, Inquiries - QR Code Text System

```
Covers anything *before or after* the booking session:

* Booking issues
* Entry/access problems
* Forgotten items
* Payment questions
* General inquiries

We can fully handle these on your behalf if your system allows it. If not, they’re cleanly routed to you or your team with full context and history attached.

This support is initiated through clearly placed signage in every bay. Customers scan a QR code that routes directly to our system, allowing them to text us for support. Additionally, we provide a dedicated support contact line listed on your facility's website. This line is **text-only**—any voice calls to the number will trigger an automatic message instructing the caller to text instead. If you choose to offer phone support separately, you retain control of that.

What this looks like in practice:

* A customer scans the bay signage or texts the support number
* Messages like “I’m having trouble booking,” “Do you have clubs on site?” or “How many people can I bring?” are all routed to us
* Our team uses your facility’s pre-filled policy questionnaire to answer on your behalf, exactly how *you* would
* Every interaction is logged and stored for reference in case of disputes
```

```
* If a problem can’t be resolved live, we issue a branded refund immediately

## Range Pods Pilot Project - Foresight Falcon Launch Monitor - River Oaks Clubhouse

```
### **Concept**

* Clubhouse is testing **Range Pods** at River Oaks — self-contained, weatherproof practice pods with advanced tracking.
* Each Range Pod is equipped with a **Foresight Falcon** launch monitor, providing industry-leading precision in outdoor conditions.
* These units allow golfers to practice with full feedback on tempo, ball flight, and club path even during off-peak hours or poor weather.

### **Operational Notes**

* Range Pods will be **seasonal** — operational spring through fall, then **stored indoors during winter** to protect sensitive equipment.
* Electronics will be removed or secured as needed for winter storage.

### **Goal**

* Extend practice utility of the range even when traditional range hours or weather limit access.
* Eventually tie into the Clubhouse ecosystem for swing data tracking, leaderboard challenges, and off-season competitions.

## Three-Step Audit Cycle - Boundary Audit - Leverage Redefinition - Upstream Integrity

```
1. Boundary Audit
	o Ask: “What part of this task is currently being handled by me that could be offloaded?”
	o Identify where human time is still being spent unnecessarily — whether out of habit, fear, or lack of system trust.
	o Look for repetitive work, linear thinking, memory burden, or emotional labor not requiring human uniqueness.
2. Leverage Redefinition
	o Redefine the role of the human in the system:
		 What is your irreplaceable function?
		 Where does your cognition outperform automation — strategy, intuition, value setting, or relational discernment?
	o Use this to recenter effort around signal — not just output.
	o If AI handles 80%, what should the 20% be?
3. Upstream Integrity Enforcement
	o Ensure systems are designed with upstream leverage in mind.
		 Fix issues at the root: structure, interface, instructions, feedback loop.
	o Avoid duct-taping human time onto broken systems.
	o If a fix requires “more effort,” that’s often a sign of poor system design.

As part of this, we install our support software on your simulator computers to enable remote control and diagnostics. We also install support cameras so our operators can see what the customer is doing in real time and guide them more effectively.

We request that each facility owner complete a detailed questionnaire outlining their refund policies, pricing structure, and any location-specific guidelines. This ensures ClubOS can respond to your customers exactly as *you* would.
