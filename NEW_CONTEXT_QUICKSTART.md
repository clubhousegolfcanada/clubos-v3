# ðŸš€ New Context Window Quick Start

## For You (Human) - Just Say:

```
"Continue" - Resume previous work
"Fix [issue]" - Debug something
"Add [feature]" - Build new feature
"Deploy" - Ship to staging/prod
"Status" - Get project state
```

Claude already read the README and knows to check the key files.

## For Claude - Automatic Execution Path

### Step 1: Check Rules & Current State (30 seconds)
```bash
cat .ai-rules                    # 6 simple rules
cat CURRENT_WORK.md             # What's active?
```

### Step 2: Get Project Context (30 seconds)
```bash
cat CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md    # Project state
grep -n "HANDOFF" CURRENT_WORK.md  # Previous work
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Task (if specific)
```bash
# Based on user request:
# "add X" â†’ cat claude-instructions/features/START.md
# "fix Y" â†’ cat claude-instructions/fixes/START.md
# "deploy" â†’ cat claude-instructions/deployment/START.md
```

### Step 4: Confirm Understanding
Claude should say something like:
```
"I see we're working on ClubOS V3, currently at version 0.4.0. 
The last session [completed X/was working on Y]. 
Should I [continue with Y/start something new]?"
```

You can say:
```
"Check CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md for project state"
```

Or more specific:
```
"Check the handoff in CURRENT_WORK.md"
"Look at the breadcrumbs in [filename]"
"Check the last SESSION_LOG.md"
```

---

## âœ… Success Indicators

Claude is properly oriented when it:
1. âœ“ Knows the version (0.4.0)
2. âœ“ Knows what was last worked on
3. âœ“ Asks relevant follow-up questions
4. âœ“ References specific files/patterns
5. âœ“ Starts working within 2 minutes

## ðŸŽª The Magic Words

**Just the task:**
```
"Add user authentication"
"Fix the timeout bug"
"Deploy to staging"
"Continue"
```

**With context:**
```
"Continue working on [feature]"
"Debug the [specific issue]"
```

**Status check:**
```
"What's the current status?"
"What was the last handoff?"
```
