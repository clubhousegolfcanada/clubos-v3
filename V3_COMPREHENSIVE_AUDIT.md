## 📚 Phase 2: Claude Context System

### 1. Create Master Context File
```markdown
# /CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md

## Project State
- Version: 0.4.0
- Status: [Development/Staging/Production]
- Last Major Change: [Date + Description]

## Active Development
- Current Sprint: [Description]
- Blocked Items: [List]
- Decisions Pending: [List]

## System Architecture
- Backend: Express + PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js 14
- APIs: OpenAI, Slack (planned: Claude, NinjaOne)
- Infrastructure: Railway + Vercel

## Key Patterns
[Link to specific pattern docs]

## Recent Changes
[Last 5 significant changes]
```

### 2. Session Continuity System
```markdown
# /claude-instructions/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md

## Starting a Session
1. Read CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md
2. Check CURRENT_WORK.md
3. Review relevant category CONTEXT.md
4. Look for [HANDOFF] tags in recent files

## During Session
- Tag decisions with [DECISION: reason]
- Tag blockers with [BLOCKED: reason]
- Tag questions with [QUESTION: for human]
- Update progress every 30 minutes

## Ending a Session
1. Update CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md
2. Create [HANDOFF] section in CURRENT_WORK.md
3. List all modified files
4. Note any incomplete work
```

### 3. Breadcrumb Architecture
```javascript
// Every significant change includes:
const breadcrumb = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  session_id: 'claude_session_2025_08_01_001',
  category: 'feature|fix|refactor|config',
  description: 'What was done',
  files_modified: ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  decisions_made: [{
    type: 'architecture|implementation|config',
    reason: 'Why this choice',
    alternatives_considered: ['option1', 'option2']
  }],
  next_steps: ['what should happen next'],
  human_input_needed: ['questions or blockers']
};
```

## 🎯 Phase 3: Core Plan Tracking

### 1. Create Living Roadmap
```markdown
# /ROADMAP_LIVE.md

## Core Vision (Unchangeable)
- AI-powered customer service
- SOP-driven automation
- Human escalation when needed

## Completed Milestones
- ✅ Message processing loop
- ✅ SOP system with matching
- ✅ Action execution framework

## Active Development
- 🏗️ Claude integration
- 🏗️ Real API connections

## Flexible Additions (Human-Tagged)
- 📋 Dashboard (requested by: @user, date)
- 📋 PWA support (business case: mobile operators)

## Rejected Ideas (With Reasons)
- ❌ Blockchain (no clear use case)
- ❌ Microservices (premature optimization)
```

### 2. Decision Log Structure
```markdown
# /docs/DECISIONS/

## Format: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md

### Decision: Add Real-time Updates
- Date: 2025-08-01
- Requested by: Operations Team
- Type: human_suggestion
- Complexity Check:
  - Clean: ✅ (WebSocket module)
  - Testable: ✅ (Can mock connections)
  - No backtracking: ✅ (Feature flag)
- Outcome: Approved
- Implementation: See PR #123
```

### 3. Flexibility Tracking
```javascript
// config/features.js
module.exports = {
  // Core features (always on)
  core: {
    messageProcessing: true,
    sopMatching: true,
    actionExecution: true
  },
  
  // Optional features (human-requested)
  optional: {
    draftGate: {
      enabled: process.env.ENABLE_DRAFT_GATE === 'true',
      requestedBy: 'operations',
      reason: 'Bad SOPs causing issues',
      addedDate: '2025-08-01'
    },
    realtimeUpdates: {
      enabled: false,
      requestedBy: null,
      reason: null,
      addedDate: null
    }
  }
};
```

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal

**A system where:**
1. Any Claude session can pick up exactly where the last left off
2. Every decision has a clear trail
3. The core plan is preserved while allowing justified flexibility
4. Documentation grows naturally through development
5. Quality improves through structured clarity, not rigid rules
