ClubOSv2 is a modular, OpenAI-powered LLM infrastructure that routes and manages all customer and ops support requests. It is designed for scale, precision, and full autonomy across agents, systems, and customer interactions.

### Core Capabilities

- SOP/file editing and Drive sync powered by Claude
- PostgreSQL backend
- Web UI for internal control (Mission Control)
- Two-way Slack integration for fallback and escalation
- Remote reset functionality via NinjaOne
