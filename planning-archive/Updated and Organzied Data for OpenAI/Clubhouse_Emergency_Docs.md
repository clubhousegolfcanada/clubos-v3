## Clubhouse 24/7 Golf Safety Protocols - Remote Responsiveness & Maintenance

```
• Prioritize Safety: Even though our locations are unmanned, our focus is on guiding customers effectively in an emergency and ensuring they feel supported.
• Remote Responsiveness: Quick communication channels are crucial. The faster we respond, the more confident customers will be in using our facilities around the clock.
• Regular Maintenance & Monitoring: Invest in proactive measures—good camera coverage, robust door control, frequent system checks—so emergencies are rare and easier to handle when they occur.

By following these procedures, Clubhouse 24/7 Golf maintains a safe, transparent environment that respects the trust customers place in a self-service, tech-enabled facility—even at 2 A.M. without staff physically on-site.
```

## Clubhouse Emergency SOP - Remote Management - Customer Guidance & Local Coordination

```
Since Clubhouse locations are remotely managed with 24/7 access for customers, this SOP outlines clear steps for handling emergencies from afar. It addresses how to inform and guide customers, coordinate with local services, and ensure brand standards are upheld even without a constant physical staff presence.

• They must evacuate immediately using posted exits.
2. Remote Support Procedure:
• If alerted, contact the local fire department for confirmation.
• Remotely unlock all facility doors via KISI (if it’s safe and feasible) to aid evacuation and emergency personnel entry.
• Notify the property manager and ownership.
3. Post-Incident:
• Work with local authorities for any required building checks or repairs.
• Temporarily disable online bookings if the site is unsafe.

4.2 Water Damage / Flooding
1. Customer Notice:
• If a customer reports water on the floor or ceiling leaks, instruct them to leave areas that appear hazardous.
2. Remote Support Procedure:
• Contact the property manager or maintenance for immediate inspection.
• Shut off main water supply remotely if technology allows; otherwise, instruct property manager to do so.
• Disable affected bay(s) in the booking system until repairs are done.

2. Remote Support Action:

3. Escalation:
• Contact the booking software provider or Stripe’s support if it’s not a local issue.
• Temporarily block walk-in usage to avoid confusion over payment.

6.2 Hardware Damage (Simulators, Projectors, PCs)

• Attempt to reboot or run diagnostic scripts if possible.
2. Customer Instructions:
• If a single bay is affected, direct customers to a functioning bay if it’s available.
• If a user is mid-session, offer them an equivalent free session later if the hardware cannot be fixed immediately.
3. Repair Coordination:

• Mark the affected bay as “Out of Service” in the booking system until resolved.
```

## Medical Emergency Response - No On-Site Staff - Customer Injury Protocols

2. Remote Support Procedure:
• If a customer calls or messages about an injury:
1. Advise them to dial 911 immediately if it’s severe.
2. If possible, remain on the line for moral support while they wait for emergency responders.
3. Log the details in the “Incident Tracker” (Section 8).
3. Follow-Up:
• After emergency services have been contacted, coordinate with them for building access if needed (via KISI or remote door controls).
• Document the event, including times, statements, any video footage from security cameras, etc.

3.2 Minor Incidents
1. Customer Contact: If a minor injury occurs (small cut or strain), direct them to first-aid supplies stored on-site (e.g., a simple first-aid kit in each bay or near the entrance).
2. Remote Support Action:
• Encourage them to seek further medical attention if necessary.
• Log the incident for internal records.
```

## Post-Emergency Follow-Up - Incident Reporting & SOP Updates - Remote Support

• Date/time, nature of the emergency, any injuries or damage, which parties were contacted, and outcome.

• Where to File:
• Maintain an online “Incident Tracker” (e.g., a shared Google Form or ticket system).

8.2 Review & Debrief
1. Team Discussion:
• Within 48 hours, the remote support team and relevant stakeholders meet (virtually) to review the incident’s timeline and handling.
• Identify any process improvements or SOP updates.
2. Customer Follow-Up:
• If a specific customer was impacted, consider a courtesy call or email, possibly offering a free session or future credit if the incident disrupted their game.

8.3 SOP Updates
• Iterate: Modify the relevant SOP sections if new technology or improved workflows become available to reduce risk or better support customers remotely.
```

## Security Protocols - Suspicious Activity & Break-Ins - Remote Monitoring & Police Coordination

```

• Lock or unlock doors as necessary to secure the property, depending on the layout and local laws.
3. Customer Safety:
• If a customer is inside and reports an intruder, advise them to call 911.
• Provide instructions to exit safely if possible.

5.2 Break-Ins or Vandalism
1. Alarm Trigger:
• If an alarm or sensor indicates forced entry, remote support checks camera feeds to confirm.
2. Call Police:
• Immediately notify local law enforcement with location details.
3. Secure Premises:
