# ClubOS V1 ‚Üí V3 Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Migrated Components

### 1. **Booking API Wrappers** (`/services/booking.js`)
- `getBookingForCustomer(phone)` - Get active/upcoming booking for customer
- `isBookingActive(booking)` - Check if booking is currently active
- `getBookings(filters)` - Query bookings with filters
- `validateCustomerAction(phone, action)` - Validate customer permissions

**V3 Usage**: Used by SOP prerequisites to check booking status before actions like door unlock.

### 2. **Remote Action Handlers** (`/services/remoteActions.js`)
- `executeResetTrackman(bay_id, location)` - Reset TrackMan equipment
- `executeUnlockDoor(bay_id, location)` - Unlock facility door
- `executeRebootPC(bay_id, location)` - Reboot simulator PC
- Device mapping for all locations

**V3 Usage**: Called by action executor when SOPs match and trigger device actions.

### 3. **Slack Notification Utility** (`/services/notifications.js`)
- `sendSlackAlert(thread_id, priority, message, context)` - Send prioritized alerts
- `sendEscalation(thread, sop, reason)` - Escalate failed actions
- `sendSystemAlert(type, message, details)` - System-level notifications
- `sendMessage(text, channel)` - Simple message sending

**V3 Usage**: Used for escalations and system alerts when actions fail or need human review.

### 4. **Claude API Helpers** (`/lib/claude.js`)
- `claudeSuggestSOP(prompt, context)` - Generate SOP suggestions from interactions
- `claudeSuggestMerge(existingSOPs)` - Identify SOPs that should be merged
- `analyzeFailure(failedAction)` - Suggest improvements for failed actions

**V3 Usage**: Powers the SOP learning and optimization system.

### 5. **Error & Retry Utilities** (`/lib/retry.js`)
- `withRetry(fn, retries, delay)` - Retry with exponential backoff
- `wrapWithErrorHandler(fn, context)` - Enhanced error context
- `withTimeout(promise, timeout, operation)` - Timeout wrapper
- `batchProcess(items, fn, concurrency)` - Concurrent batch processing
- `CircuitBreaker` class - Prevent cascading failures

**V3 Usage**: Wraps external API calls and critical operations for resilience.

## üîß Integration Points

### Updated Action Executor
The main action executor (`/services/actionExecutor.js`) now uses all migrated services:
- Booking validation before door unlock
- Remote action execution through NinjaOne/Ubiquiti wrappers
- Slack escalation through notification service
- All wrapped with error handling utilities

### Database Compatibility
All migrated services use the V3 database schema:
- `bookings` table for booking queries
- `thread` table for context
- `action_log` for tracking executions

### Configuration
Required environment variables:
```env
# Remote Actions
NINJAONE_CLIENT_ID=your-ninjaone-id
NINJAONE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-ninjaone-secret
UBIQUITI_API_KEY=your-ubiquiti-key

# Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...
SLACK_CHANNEL=#clubos-alerts

# Claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229
```

## üìù Migration Notes

1. **TypeScript ‚Üí JavaScript**: Converted to plain JavaScript to match V3's current setup
2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced with correlation IDs and structured logging
3. **Demo Mode**: All services support demo/simulation mode when APIs aren't configured
4. **Modular Design**: Each service is independent and can be tested separately

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**: Run end-to-end tests with the migrated services
2. **API Implementation**: Complete the TODO placeholders for:
   - NinjaOne API integration
   - Ubiquiti UniFi Access API
   - OpenPhone messaging
3. **Production Config**: Update device IDs and script IDs with real values
4. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust timeouts and retry counts based on real-world usage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Migrated

These V1 components were intentionally left behind:
- Markdown-based SOPs (replaced with JSON)
- Freeform ticket logic (now structured)
- Chatbot response builders (V3 is action-focused)
- Static UI components (V3 has new mobile-first UI)

The migration focuses on stable, reusable logic that fits V3's clean-core architecture.
