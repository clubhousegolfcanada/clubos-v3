# Mobile & PWA Strategy for ClubOS V3

## Overview
ClubOS V3 will support mobile access through Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, providing app-like experience without app store requirements.

## Why PWA Over Native Apps?
1. **Single codebase** - No separate iOS/Android development
2. **Instant updates** - No app store approval delays
3. **Lower cost** - No developer accounts or app store fees
4. **Easy deployment** - Updates through web deployment
5. **Cross-platform** - Works on all devices with modern browsers

## PWA Features to Implement

### Phase 1: Basic PWA (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- [ ] Service Worker for offline capability
- [ ] App icons (multiple sizes)
- [ ] Splash screens
- [ ] Add to Home Screen prompt
- [ ] Basic offline page

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Push notifications for urgent alerts
- [ ] Background sync for message queue
- [ ] Offline message drafting
- [ ] Camera access for photo uploads
- [ ] Geolocation for venue-based features
- [ ] File system access for documents

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities
- [ ] WebRTC for voice calls (future)
- [ ] Bluetooth for IoT device control
- [ ] NFC for access cards (if supported)
- [ ] Biometric authentication

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Manifest File
```json
{
  "name": "ClubOS - The Clubhouse",
  "short_name": "ClubOS",
  "description": "Customer service system for The Clubhouse",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Service Worker Strategy
- Cache-first for static assets
- Network-first for API calls
- Queue actions when offline
- Sync when connection restored

### 3. Next.js PWA Setup
```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

### 4. Push Notifications
- Use Web Push API
- Integrate with existing Slack alerts
- Priority levels for different alerts

## User Experience

### Mobile-Specific Features
1. **Quick Actions** - Large touch targets
2. **Swipe Gestures** - Navigate threads
3. **Voice Input** - Hands-free operation
4. **Haptic Feedback** - Action confirmations
5. **Dark Mode** - Battery saving

### Offline Capabilities
1. View recent threads
2. Read SOPs
3. Queue messages
4. Access contact info
5. View schedules

## Alternative: Native App Wrapper

If app store presence becomes required:

### Option 1: Capacitor
- Wrap existing web app
- Access native APIs
- Minimal code changes
- Quick to market

### Option 2: React Native
- Share code with web
- Better performance
- More native features
- Higher development cost

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Basic PWA setup
   - Manifest, icons, service worker
   - Install prompts

2. **Week 3-4**: Offline functionality
   - Cache strategies
   - Offline pages
   - Queue system

3. **Week 5-6**: Push notifications
   - Permission flow
   - Notification handling
   - Integration with backend

4. **Week 7-8**: Testing & refinement
   - Cross-device testing
   - Performance optimization
   - User feedback

## Success Metrics

- Install rate on staff devices
- Offline usage patterns
- Push notification engagement
- Page load performance
- User satisfaction scores

## Resources Needed

1. **Design**: App icons, splash screens
2. **Development**: 4-6 weeks for full PWA
3. **Testing**: Multiple devices/browsers
4. **Marketing**: Staff training on installation
