#### 🚀 In Progress - Infrastructure (Week 2)
- [ ] Add GitHub secrets for deployment
- [ ] Set up Railway account
- [ ] Set up Vercel account
- [ ] Deploy backend to Railway
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel
- [ ] Frontend testing (React Testing Library)

#### 📋 Upcoming - Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Obtain production API keys
- [ ] Implement Claude SOP analysis
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Sentry + health checks)
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger)
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## 📋 Planned Features (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Core Completion
1. **Claude Integration** 
   - SOP ingestion endpoint
   - Merge suggestion system
   - Learning effectiveness tracking

2. **Real API Connections**
   - OpenPhone (SMS/calling)
   - NinjaOne (device management)
   - Ubiquiti (network control)

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security audit

### Phase 2: Enhancements
1. **PWA Support** `[human_request: mobile operators]`
   - Service worker
   - Offline capability
   - Push notifications

2. **Real-time Updates** `[pending human_request]`
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live thread updates
   - Instant notifications

3. **Advanced Analytics** `[pending business case]`
   - SOP effectiveness dashboard
   - Response time metrics
   - Cost analysis

### Phase 3: Future Considerations

#### Booking Platform (Not Active)
- **Status**: Comprehensive plan documented
- **Timeline**: 20 weeks when approved
- **Architecture**: Standalone microservice
- **Details**: See BOOKING_PLATFORM_COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN.md
- **Decision**: Deferred until core V3 features stable

### Phase 4: Adaptive Learning & Pattern Recognition
1. **Session-Level Reflex Memory** `[latent capability]`
   - Track interaction context within sessions
   - Adaptive tone and escalation paths
   - Post-session human review

2. **Historical Log Recall** `[latent capability]`
   - Semantic similarity matching (≥95%)
   - Past resolution suggestions
   - Learning from operator decisions

3. **Customer Behavior Patterns** `[latent capability]`
   - Detect recurring behaviors (resets, cancellations)
   - Surface patterns for human review
   - Store approved decisions as reflex logic

4. **Time/Location Heuristics** `[latent capability]`
   - Incident clustering analysis
   - Predictive SOP pre-loading
   - Location-based pattern detection

5. **SOP Evolution Tracking** `[latent capability]`
   - Track edge cases and overrides
   - Propose SOP updates after patterns emerge
   - Version-controlled improvements

6. **Remote Environment Control** `[depends on: NinjaOne API]`
   - Sensor-triggered actions with approval
   - Predictive reset heuristics
   - Historical outcome tracking

## 🏷️ Human-Tagged Additions

### Approved
```javascript
{
  "user_avatars": {
    requested_by: "@john",
    date: "2025-07-15",
    reason: "Operators want profile pictures",
    status: "planned",
    complexity: "medium"
  }
}
```

### Under Consideration
```javascript
{
  "multi_tenant": {
    requested_by: null,
    date: null,
    reason: "Potential enterprise clients",
    status: "researching",
    complexity: "high"
  }
}
```

### Rejected
```javascript
{
  "blockchain_integration": {
    requested_by: "@ai_speculation",
    date: "2025-07-01",
    reason: "No clear use case",
    status: "rejected",
    complexity: "very_high"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Flexibility Framework

### When to Add Features
```
IF human_request = true
  AND clear_use_case = true
  AND complexity_acceptable = true
  AND no_core_disruption = true
THEN approve_feature()
```

### When to Say No
```
IF speculative = true
  OR over_engineered = true
  OR breaks_core_flow = true
  OR no_clear_owner = true
THEN reject_feature()
```
