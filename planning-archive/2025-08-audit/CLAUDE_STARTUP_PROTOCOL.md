# üöÄ Claude Startup Protocol

## When You Type `claude` in Warp

### What Happens Automatically:
1. **Claude reads key context files** (built into the system)
   - Project type, version, current state
   - Recent work and handoffs
   - Active tasks and blockers

2. **Claude is ready with:**
   - Full project context (ClubOS V3, v0.4.0)
   - Knowledge of what was last worked on
   - Understanding of patterns and conventions
   - Ready to continue or start new work

### Your First Message Options:

#### Option 1: Continue Previous Work
```
"Continue"
```
Claude will:
- Check CURRENT_WORK.md for HANDOFF
- Resume exactly where last session ended
- Update SESSION_LOG.md automatically

#### Option 2: Start Specific Task
```
"Add user authentication"
"Fix the login timeout"
"Deploy to staging"
```
Claude will:
- Navigate to appropriate docs
- Check for existing patterns
- Start implementation
- Log everything in SESSION_LOG.md

#### Option 3: Status Check
```
"Status"
"What's the current state?"
```
Claude will:
- Summarize from CLAUDE_MASTER_CONTEXT.md
- Show active work from CURRENT_WORK.md
- List any blockers

## üìä Automatic Logging

### Claude Automatically Logs:

1. **Session Start**
   ```markdown
   [SESSION: 2025-08-01-001] Started at 14:30
   [CONTEXT] Read CURRENT_WORK.md, found active task: user auth
   ```

2. **During Work** (every 30 min)
   ```markdown
   [PROGRESS: 14:45] Completed auth endpoints, testing
   [DECISION] Chose JWT over sessions for stateless auth
   ```

3. **File Changes**
   ```markdown
   [MODIFIED] /backend/src/routes/auth.js - Added login endpoint
   [CREATED] /backend/src/services/authService.js - Auth logic
   ```

4. **Session End**
   ```markdown
   [HANDOFF] Session 2025-08-01-001 Summary
   - Completed: Auth endpoints, JWT integration
   - Blocked: Need password requirements decision
   - Next: Frontend auth forms
   ```
