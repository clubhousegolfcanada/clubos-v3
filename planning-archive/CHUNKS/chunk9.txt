Claude Breakdown: Chunk 9 ? Notification Routing, Slack Escalation, and Role-Based Alerting

? Scope

Define how ClubOS V2 handles notifications, including Slack escalations, high-priority message routing, and per-operator alert controls. Ensures signal is scoped, timely, and role-relevant ? preventing alert fatigue and enabling response clarity.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionAll escalations sent manually? AI triggers Slack escalation automatically, based on rulesSingle Slack feed? Per-role or per-user Slack channel assignmentAll users notified equally? Notification scope defined by operator role and location group
?? Dependencies
* Slack App + Webhook integration
* Notification logic layer in backend (role-aware)
* Thread metadata + escalation reason included in payload

?? Tasks

[9.1] Escalation Trigger Routing

AI triggers Slack notification when:
* Action fails (e.g. reset did not resolve issue)
* Confidence score below configured threshold
* Message tagged as human_required
* System anomaly detected (e.g. all PCs offline at once)

Slack message format:
{
  "channel": "#mike-alerts",
  "text": "Escalation: Bay 2 TrackMan not responding after reset",
  "thread_id": "msg-9123",
  "location": "Bedford",
  "customer": "John D.",
  "trigger": "AI reset failed",
  "link": "https://clubos.app/thread/msg-9123"
}

[9.2] Role-Scoped Slack Channels

Each operator or group is subscribed to relevant alerts only:
{
  "user": "mike",
  "location_scope": ["Bedford", "Dartmouth"],
  "alert_types": ["tech", "access", "emergency"],
  "channel": "#mike-alerts"
}
Keeps irrelevant threads out of inbox and aligns to operator ownership

[9.3] Alert Preferences + Controls

Operators can configure alert scope:
* Channel (shared or personal)
* What categories they want:
o only escalated
o new customer messages
o system anomalies
* Alert frequency:
o immediate
o daily digest
o grouped by thread

Example config:
{
  "alert_frequency": "grouped",
  "notify_on": ["escalation", "new message", "offline detection"],
  "channel": "#tech-support"
}

[9.4] AI + Slack Interplay

When AI escalates to Slack:
* It stops responding in-thread
* Thread status set to escalated
* Slack alert includes:
o Summary of actions attempted
o Proposed next steps
o Whether customer is still waiting

If human responds in Slack and resolves, Claude:
* Updates thread to resolved_by_human
* Logs resolution path
* Tags outcome quality if approved

[9.5] Daily Summary / Digest (Optional)

Optional feature:
* Daily Slack digest of:
o Unresolved escalations
o High-signal failures
o SOPs triggered more than 5x
* Posted to #daily-clubhouse-digest or emailed

? Expected Behavior
* Only the right people are alerted, at the right time
* Slack alerts are traceable, actionable, and scoped
* Escalated threads pause AI activity until a human responds
* Claude learns only from resolved + tagged escalations
