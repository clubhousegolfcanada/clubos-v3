Claude Breakdown: Chunk 5 ? Knowledge Upload, Feedback Dashboard, and Learning Controls

? Scope

Define how operators add, modify, or validate new knowledge in ClubOS. Covers the Knowledge Upload interface, Claude-assisted SOP ingestion, tagging of high-quality interactions, and mechanisms for flagging or reinforcing learning.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionManual SOP updates only? AI-assisted upload + Claude categorizationNo tagging of message quality? Operators can ?star? high-quality interactionsLearning from all messages? Learning restricted to admin accounts + tagged threads
?? Dependencies
* Claude SOP parser tool (reads input ? structured format)
* Feedback dashboard UI (in Admin panel)
* Access to SOP DB and Message Log store
* Role-based permission control

?? Tasks

[5.1] Knowledge Upload Flow

Operators can:
* Paste freeform rule logic (e.g. ?Refund allowed if >10min before session?)
* Upload a document or SOP file
* Select optional category and metadata

Claude does:
* Categorization
* Conflict detection
* Structure generation
* Drafts sop.json format and sends to review queue

UI presents:
* Claude?s suggested SOP summary
* Source (freeform / file / upload)
* Auto-assigned category + fallback
* Accept / Edit / Reject

[5.2] Feedback Dashboard

UI interface shows:
* Auto-detected candidate rules (from message logs)
* Flagged ambiguous threads
* Duplicate SOPs
* Pending Claude merges
* History of all past updates (sortable/filterable)

Operators can:
* Approve Claude suggestions
* Manually edit draft SOPs
* Re-tag past logs
* Archive old or unused logic

[5.3] Tagging High-Quality Interactions

Operators can mark:
* Specific threads as ??? Use for future learning?
* Individual replies as ?? Good phrasing?
* Claude-proposed new rules as ??? Canonical?

These create feedback signals:
{
  "type": "learning_signal",
  "source": "message",
  "by": "admin_mike",
  "linked_sop": "booking-022",
  "confidence_boost": 0.15
}

[5.4] Learning Access Controls
* Only approved roles can create learning tags
* Default: admin and supervisor accounts
* Role config:
{
  "role": "tech",
  "can_tag_learning": false,
  "can_upload_knowledge": true
}


AI learns only from:
* Approved tagged threads
* Claude-reviewed logic
* Operator-marked canonical flows

? Expected Behavior
* SOP ingestion is clean, human-guided, and structured
* Claude acts as a logic processor ? not as an auto-updater
* Operators curate what gets learned from and what doesn?t
* Feedback dashboard is the central place for improving logic
