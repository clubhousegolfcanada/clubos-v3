# ðŸŒŠ Flexible Development Approach

## Core Principle
**Build what's needed when it's needed, not because a rule says so.**

## The Real Rules

### 1. Listen to Actual Needs
- User asks for dashboard? Build it.
- Need analytics? Add them.
- Want feature toggles? Implement them.
- The "don't" list is just a reminder to avoid complexity WITHOUT purpose.

### 2. Logic Improvements Are Guidelines
- Draft gate? Only if SOPs are causing problems
- Learning metrics? Only if we need to measure
- Override tracking? Only if operators complain
- Implement when pain is felt, not preemptively

### 3. Pragmatic Implementation
```javascript
// Instead of complex draft system
if (process.env.ENABLE_DRAFT_GATE === 'true') {
  // Use draft gate
} else {
  // All SOPs are live
}
```

### 4. Start Simple, Evolve
- Day 1: Basic feature works
- Week 1: Notice patterns
- Month 1: Add improvements IF needed
- Never: Add complexity without clear benefit

## Examples of Flexibility

### "Never add dashboards"
Reality: If operators need to see SOP performance â†’ Build simple dashboard

### "Don't expand notification surfaces"  
Reality: If Slack isn't enough â†’ Add email/SMS when requested

### "No multi-tenant logic"
Reality: If you get enterprise customer â†’ Add it then

### "Claude must not reference files"
Reality: If it helps Claude work better â†’ Reference away

## The Meta Rule

**Every rule can be broken if it makes the product better for users.**

The logic improvements are tools in the toolbox, not commandments:
- Use them when they solve real problems
- Skip them when they add complexity without value
- Modify them when your use case differs

## Practical Approach

### Week 1
- Ship core features
- See what breaks
- Note pain points

### Week 2
- Fix actual problems
- Add measurements where needed
- Implement improvements that matter

### Week 3+
- Iterate based on usage
- Add complexity only where it provides value
- Keep what works, remove what doesn't
