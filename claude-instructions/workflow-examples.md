## Benefits of This System

1. **Focused Reading** - Each file < 100 lines
2. **Clear Navigation** - Decision tree guides to right file
3. **No Repetition** - Each file has unique purpose
4. **Easy Updates** - Change one file, not entire docs
5. **Scalable** - Add new paths without breaking existing

## How to Add New Instructions

1. Identify the category (feature/fix/deploy/etc)
2. Create specific file in that directory
3. Update the START.md to point to it
4. Keep it under 100 lines
5. Focus on ONE specific task
