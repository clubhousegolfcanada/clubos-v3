Claude Breakdown: Chunk 6 ? Logging, Audit Trails, and Change History

? Scope

Define how ClubOS V2 logs all relevant actions, conversations, decisions, and changes. This includes AI actions, human overrides, SOP edits, escalations, and Claude-proposed modifications. Ensures full traceability and controlled learning.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionFlat message logs? Structured logs with context, category, linked actionsAll interactions learned from? Only tagged/logged messages with learning markersClaude edits not tracked? All Claude-suggested changes logged + versioned
?? Dependencies
* action_log, message_log, and change_log DB tables
* Internal log viewer (or log stream piped to external viewer like Supabase/Hasura UI)
* Optional: daily/weekly export to GDrive or backup

?? Tasks

[6.1] Action Log (System-Level)

Every AI or operator action is recorded as:
{
  "type": "reset_trackman",
  "initiated_by": "OperatorGPT",
  "booking_id": "bk-3281",
  "bay": "2",
  "location": "Bedford",
  "outcome": "success",
  "sop_id": "tech-008",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T15:11:32Z",
  "confirmed_by": "system"
}
Includes:
* Execution result
* System confirmation (e.g. PC back online)
* Related SOP and operator if involved

[6.2] Message Log (Thread Context)

Each customer message + response is logged:
{
  "thread_id": "msg-9817",
  "customer_id": "cust-20012",
  "message": "TrackMan isn?t working",
  "ai_reply": "I?ve reset it ? try now.",
  "status": "escalated",
  "intent": "tech_issue",
  "linked_actions": ["reset_trackman"],
  "tags": ["flag_for_learning"]
}
Used for:
* Feedback dashboard
* Training signal
* Thread history reconstruction

[6.3] Change Log (SOP & Claude)

Tracks all Claude suggestions + human edits:
{
  "change_type": "merge",
  "source_sop": "booking-003",
  "target_sop": "booking-007",
  "proposed_by": "Claude",
  "approved_by": "mike",
  "diff_summary": "Combined refund windows for <10min bookings",
  "status": "live",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T15:42:10Z"
}
All SOPs include:
* Last editor
* Edit history
* Approval trail
* Rollback capability (manual)

[6.4] Log-Based Learning Signal Control

Only logs with:
* Tagged "flag_for_learning", or
* "confirmed_success" attached
? Are pulled into Claude?s weekly logic review

Others archived but not used for pattern generation

[6.5] Optional: Log Export + Sync
* Logs can be:
o Exported to CSV
o Backed up nightly to GDrive
o Piped to another system (e.g. S3, Google Cloud, or Postgres clone)

Claude can summarize logs weekly into:
* Most used SOPs
* Failed actions
* Escalation patterns

? Expected Behavior
* Full traceability of all decisions and actions
* Claude doesn?t hallucinate from logs ? it learns only what?s been marked
* Any past decision, escalation, or edit can be audited
* Human always has final say in what becomes SOP
