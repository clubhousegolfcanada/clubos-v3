# Decision: Flexible Implementation Over Rigid Rules

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-08-01
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Deciders**: [@human, @claude]
- **Category**: Process

## Context
The original logic improvements document contained many "NEVER" rules that could prevent building useful features. Real-world development requires flexibility to respond to actual user needs rather than following predetermined restrictions.

## Decision
Adopt a flexible implementation approach where:
1. All rules can be broken with proper justification
2. Features are built when humans request them
3. Complexity is added only when it solves real problems
4. Implementation uses feature flags for optional components

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Rigid Rule Following
- **Pros**: Clear boundaries, prevents scope creep
- **Cons**: Might miss valuable features, frustrates users
- **Effort**: Low (just say no)

### Option 2: No Rules
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility
- **Cons**: Leads to bloat, inconsistency
- **Effort**: Low initially, high over time

### Option 3: Flexible Guidelines (Chosen)
- **Pros**: Responds to real needs, maintains quality
- **Cons**: Requires judgment calls
- **Effort**: Medium

## Consequences

### Positive
- Can build what users actually need
- Avoids over-engineering
- Maintains development velocity
- Keeps team morale high

### Negative  
- Requires more decision-making
- Could lead to inconsistency
- Need to track why things were added

### Neutral
- More documentation of decisions
- Regular review of additions

## Implementation
- **Effort Required**: Immediate
- **Breaking Changes**: No
- **Migration Needed**: No

## Validation
Success means:
- [ ] Users get features they request
- [ ] Codebase remains maintainable
- [ ] Decisions are well-documented
- [ ] Team feels empowered
