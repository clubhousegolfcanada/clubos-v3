Claude Breakdown: Chunk 10 ? Learning Governance, Category Merging, and SOP Evolution

? Scope

Define how ClubOS V2 evolves over time: how Claude proposes new logic, how categories are split or merged, and how AI?s learning is human-guided, audit-logged, and scoped to only high-quality signals. Prevents logic sprawl and maintains trust.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionAll messages used for AI learning? Only admin-approved or tagged threads contribute to LLM learningStatic SOP categories? SOP categories can evolve, merge, or branch based on message patternsNo pattern summarization? Claude can propose new categories based on ambiguous thread clustering
?? Dependencies
* Claude for similarity clustering + SOP suggestion
* Weekly background job for log + SOP review
* Feedback dashboard interface
* SOP version store with merge/edit capabilities

?? Tasks

[10.1] Learning Permissions and Filtering

AI learns only from:
* Threads marked flag_for_learning
* Operators with learning-enabled roles
* Interactions where SOP was followed and outcome confirmed

All others are archived for reference but not used as training signal.

Operator tagging (UI):

?? Use this phrasing in future?
??? Great outcome, promote this logic?

Backend stores:
{
  "type": "learning_tag",
  "linked_thread": "msg-9012",
  "linked_sop": "booking-011",
  "by": "admin_mike",
  "confidence_boost": 0.2
}

[10.2] Category Merge + Creation

When Claude detects:
* High overlap across SOPs (e.g. cancellation policies, promo edge cases)
* Or a growing pool of ambiguous messages

It proposes:
* Merge SOPs into one canonical rule
* Create new subcategory (e.g. Calibration, Simulator Prep, Events)
* Re-tag old SOPs to new structure

Admin review modal:

?These 19 messages appear to describe warm-up/cooldown processes.
Would you like to create a new SOP category??

If approved:
* Claude reindexes SOP vector space
* LLM prompt condition is updated to include new route

[10.3] SOP Change Summarization + Digest

Claude auto-generates:
* Weekly summary of merged rules
* Suggested deprecations
* Newly created SOPs from logs

Each change is logged in change_log:
{
  "change_type": "category_merge",
  "merged_sops": ["booking-012", "booking-018"],
  "summary": "Unified last-minute refund logic",
  "status": "approved",
  "approved_by": "admin_mike"
}
Digest is available in dashboard or Slack/email summary.

[10.4] Preventing Logic Drift

To avoid the AI learning false patterns:
* Claude flags outlier threads (?This message deviates from known SOPs?)
* High-volume SOPs are auto-reviewed if override rate is high
* Operator can lock SOPs:
{
  "mergeable": false,
  "allow_override_learning": false
}

[10.5] Claude-Only Learning Separation

Claude?s knowledge evolution is scoped to:
* SOP logic
* Categorization structures
* Pattern recognition

GPT-based LLM handles:
* Live routing
* Actions
* Replies

Separation ensures Claude doesn?t learn customer phrasing or human behavior directly.

? Expected Behavior
* ClubOS evolves only from trusted, intentional inputs
* Claude handles all structural improvement proposals
* Operators control whether logic grows or consolidates
* System scales in clarity, not complexity
