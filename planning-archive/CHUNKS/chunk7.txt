Claude Breakdown: Chunk 7 ? System Monitoring, Device Status, and Environment Triggers

? Scope

Define how ClubOS V2 integrates with systems like NinjaOne and Ubiquiti to monitor real-time device health, booking-related activity, and passive anomalies. Covers proactive flags, AI alerts, and human-aware triggers (e.g. no-shows, location offline).

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionNo proactive AI monitoring? AI monitors device + location state but does not act autonomouslyNinjaOne mentioned but undefined? NinjaOne used for PC uptime + service state trackingNo logic for booking dropouts? Booking no-shows flagged to operator, not resolved by AI
?? Dependencies
* NinjaOne API access (PC online status, uptime, reset options)
* Ubiquiti access logs (door opened, customer connected)
* Booking data sync (from Skedda or Jason?s custom system)

?? Tasks

[7.1] Device Status Polling / Webhook Listening

Each location?s core systems are tracked:
* TrackMan PC (via NinjaOne)
* Projector (optional future)
* Network connectivity (via Ubiquiti or ping logic)
* Booking activity (via internal DB or Jason?s system)

Track:
{
  "location": "Dartmouth",
  "bay": "4",
  "pc_online": false,
  "last_ping": "2025-08-01T14:03:00Z",
  "booking_active": true,
  "auto_flag": true,
  "flag_type": "device_offline_during_booking"
}

[7.2] Booking No-Show Detection

If booking ends, and:
* No access log (door_unlocked = false)
* No AI interaction or system usage
? Thread is tagged as "booking_no_show"

Flag is surfaced:
* On operator dashboard
* Optional Slack notification
* Option to log refund, message customer, or mark complete

[7.3] Location-Wide Offline Detection

If all PCs in a location go offline within a short time window:
* AI flags it as potential_power_loss
* Escalation Slack alert sent to owner/operator role
* AI does not take action (no reset/reboot logic initiated)

Operator sees:
* Last heartbeat per bay
* Active bookings impacted
* Common failure reason suggestion (if known from past logs)

[7.4] Passive Monitoring Triggers

System watches for soft anomalies like:
* Multiple failed TrackMan resets within short window
* Recurring ?no booking found? messages at a bay
* High escalation rate from a single customer

Claude proposes:
* Pattern: "trackman_reset_failure_cluster_03"
* Action: ?Suggest reviewing SOP tech-010?
* Operator can review flagged cluster from logs

[7.5] Alert Grouping + Noise Reduction
* Alerts from same location or bay within X minutes are grouped
* Claude deduplicates recurring errors
* Optional thresholds per alert type:
{
  "device_offline_timeout": 3,
  "group_similar_alerts": true
}


? Expected Behavior
* AI never acts on system data alone ? it flags and suggests only
* All device state changes are tracked and linked to active threads (if any)
* Operators get high-signal alerts only ? grouped, annotated, and tied to booking context
* Claude builds passive pattern awareness to evolve logic over time
