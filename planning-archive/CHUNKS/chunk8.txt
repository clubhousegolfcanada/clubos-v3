Claude Breakdown: Chunk 8 ? Frontend Layout, Mobile UX, and Desktop Controls

? Scope

Define the UI structure for ClubOS V2 ? prioritizing mobile-first message interaction, context-aware action panes, and a minimal desktop interface for admin oversight and SOP curation. Focused on efficiency, clarity, and operator speed.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionDashboard-first UI? Messaging is the homepage ? dashboard is secondarySeparate UI per LLM? Single LLM interface ? logic visible per message threadNo action controls defined? Context-aware swipe-up action panel (mobile) or sidebar (web)All users shared view? Role-scoped visibility and controls per user
?? Dependencies
* Next.js frontend deployed on Vercel
* Tailwind CSS UI framework
* React state for UI tab management + operator-specific state

?? Tasks

[8.1] Mobile-First Layout
* Default view = Message Inbox
o Chronological list of active threads
o Badges: ?Escalated?, ?In Progress?, ?Resolved?
o Each entry includes:
* Customer name / phone
* Location + bay (if booking found)
* Status icon
* Last message preview

[8.2] Thread View (Mobile)
* Header:
o Booking info (time, bay, location)
o Thread status (ai_resolved, escalated, etc.)
* Main area:
o Message log (left: customer, right: AI/human)
o AI suggestions appear as ghost replies or buttons
* Bottom:
o Swipe-up Action Panel with dynamic buttons:
* Reset TrackMan
* Unlock door
* Escalate to Slack
* View linked SOP
* Confirm refund

[8.3] Desktop View (Admin + Ops)
* Split-pane layout:
o Left: thread list
o Center: selected message + actions
o Right: optional live context panel (status, actions taken, logs)
* Tab system:
o Messages
o Escalations
o Knowledge
o Logs
o Settings
* Claude summaries / SOP merge prompts shown as sidebar modals

[8.4] Role-Based View Control
* UI components rendered conditionally based on role:
o Operators see message + action panel
o Admins see all tabs, including SOP tools
o Tech sees system panel but not booking info
* Role config:
{
  "role": "operator",
  "visible_tabs": ["Messages", "Escalations"],
  "action_permissions": ["reset", "unlock"]
}


[8.5] Live Thread Summary & LLM Transparency

Every thread shows:
* Actions AI took
* SOP used
* Claude comments (if triggered)
* ?View Reasoning? toggle if LLM decision-making needs transparency

Prevents trust breakdown by surfacing logic chain when needed

? Expected Behavior
* Mobile interface is focused, efficient, and swipe-action based
* Desktop interface supports oversight, cleanup, and training
* Operators know what AI is doing, when, and why
* Admins can act without switching between systems
* Claude suggestions appear cleanly in knowledge dashboard tab
