Claude Breakdown: Chunk 3 ? Action Execution, System State, and Outcome Logging

? Scope

Define how ClubOS executes system actions (e.g. reset TrackMan, unlock door), how it confirms outcomes via system APIs (NinjaOne, Ubiquiti, etc.), and how all results are logged and scored for audit and learning.

?? Cross-Referenced Corrections
Early PlanFinal DecisionRetry/reset logic was linear? Retry logic is governed by config per categoryRollback support discussed? No AI rollback ? flag only, manual operator correctionLogs were unstructured? Outcome logs are fully structured + versioned
?? Dependencies
* System API access:
o NinjaOne: PC status, uptime, remote reset
o Ubiquiti: door logs, connection attempts
o TrackMan: local ping or shell tool (custom handler)
* OpenPhone: message confirmations
* Audit logging DB

?? Tasks

[3.1] Action Execution Wrapper

All AI-triggered actions run through a central function:
performAction({
  action: "reset_trackman",
  target: "bay_3",
  triggered_by: "OperatorGPT",
  reason: "trackman_freeze_sop_12",
  booking_id: "bk-390128"
})
* Calls associated tool/API
* Waits for system confirmation (e.g. PC online, logs cleared)
* Timeout if no state change in X seconds
* Sets action_status: success | failed | inconclusive

[3.2] Structured Outcome Logging

Every action creates an entry:
{
  "action": "reset_trackman",
  "bay": "3",
  "location": "Bedford",
  "result": "success",
  "followed_sop": "trackman_freeze_sop_12",
  "trigger_source": "OperatorGPT",
  "human_override": false,
  "linked_thread": "msg_812",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T18:35:20Z"
}

[3.3] Failure ? Escalation Trigger

If:
* Action fails
* OR no customer confirmation
* OR system state unchanged

Then:
* Thread escalates to operator
* Operator sees full action log + error state
* Claude flags any potential SOP mismatches for later review

[3.4] No Rollbacks ? Only Manual Correction

If AI makes an incorrect destructive action (e.g. unlocks wrong door):
* Flag added: "rollback_needed"
* Operator notified in Slack + dashboard
* Claude proposes SOP revision path only ? does not undo

[3.5] Action Chain Templates (Optional Extension)

Later:
* Claude can store chains like:
{
  "scenario": "no_booking_found",
  "actions": ["check_phone_variants", "check_bay_overlap", "escalate"]
}
But for V2, action logic is one-step at a time + human fallback.

? Expected Behavior
* All actions pass through a single router
* System state is always checked post-action
* Results are logged in structured format for audit + learning
* Operator has full visibility into what was attempted and why
* Claude can later suggest SOP improvements based on outcome history
