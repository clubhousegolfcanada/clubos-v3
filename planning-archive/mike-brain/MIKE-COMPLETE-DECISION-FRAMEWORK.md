# Mike's Complete Decision Framework

This maps exactly how I make decisions, with real examples from conversations.

## 1. Core Decision Patterns

### Condition Action

**IF**: y
**THEN**: ou think about the process and my mental model and recursivity and all that stuff, the last year running Clubhouse Box was collecting data, doing all the work manually, but not manually, more automated than anyone else, but to me it felt manual
*Context*: Data collection and automation

**IF**: w
**THEN**: e could automate some of the tasks
*Context*: Data collection and automation

**IF**: t
**THEN**: his is going to be worth money
*Context*: Data collection and automation

**IF**: i
**THEN**: t'll go anywhere
*Context*: Data collection and automation

**IF**: I
**THEN**: 'm just learning something by myself that no one else has learned
*Context*: Data collection and automation

### Problem Solution

**IF**: consent to marketing, privacy policy. We can use their data for, you know, all the standard purposes. I'll usually just put a tag on any AI response in the chat that says, AI health, AI actions or something, that's fine. Strict access control, to be honest, there's only the owners that have access to the database or the admin panel or the logins for our repository and everything. Cross-border use, no idea. I don't know if they take it overboard or not. I don't know if their servers are in Canada. And then we can obviously explain how AI makes decisions
**THEN**: we log everything
*Context*: AI laws in Canada

### Choice Reasoning

**IF**: a PNG
  image. It might be a placeholder or corrupted file. Let me check its contents:

⏺ Read(clubos-icon-192.png)
  ⎿  Read image (108 bytes)
  ⎿ AP
**THEN**: Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Could
     not process image"}}


> i updated the files in the front end public folde
  ⎿ API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Could
     not process image"}}


> whats happeninh
  ⎿ API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Could
     not process image"}}


> claude
  ⎿ API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Could
     not process image"}}


> are you down?
  ⎿ API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Could
     not process image"}}

**IF**: building V2 from 
     scratch
**THEN**: transformed the planning into V3 by intelligently porting working 
     components from V1
*Context*: Parallel Claude Workflow

**IF**: building V2 
         - from scratch
**THEN**: transformed the planning into V3 by intelligently porting 
         - working components from V1
*Context*: Parallel Claude Workflow

**IF**: complex planning:
  - A
**THEN**: reads 5 simple rules
  - Finds similar code to copy
  - Modifies for new feature
  - Ships working code
  - Updates context

  This system prioritizes:
  - Execution speed over perfection
  - Pattern reuse over reinvention
  - Shipping features over discussing
  - Breadcrumbs over documentation

  The highest leverage approach: Build fast with consistent patterns, leaving just enough
  context for the next session! 🏃‍♂️

## 2. Core Beliefs → Actions

**Belief**: I'm still working on version 1
**Results in**: started laying the foundation, the scaffolding, and the logic for V2 from all the things that I didn't know because I've never coded before

**Belief**: think about the process and my mental model and recursivity and all that stuff, the last year running Clubhouse Box was collecting data, doing all the work manually, but not manually, more automated than anyone else, but to me it felt manual. Every customer issue had to go through a human, even if we could automate some of the tasks. And so I took a year to grab information, knowing it's saving to open data storage, knowing that we have all the booking saves, know that we're compiling all the information, so it's not a waste of time. So then the summer comes around, I have more time, yes we need funding, but this is the time where we automate everything. I didn't know how it goes, I didn't know, it was just like I live my life
**Results in**: learn things, you leave an open mind, and you try and connect them and implement them in different ways

**Belief**: i have tried and done so many things my logic could be the best
**Results in**: just cant always access it 100% of the time all the time

**Belief**: we can flip and compare them with current logs. So, for example, we're not going to have thousands and thousands of customer logs that say they needed to reset TrackMan. We'll keep one, but then once the logic's there
**Results in**: don't really need the message anymore either

**Belief**: that’s why I don’t care about when someone knows someone through someone. Its not the kind of depth I care about. I care about things like  “ giving (not loan) a person money without them asking when they want to start an idea.. I knew almost everyone was looking into what was in it for themselves and its okay. I just figured out I could make a world where helping others actually benefits you more than the help you give them, and not in a manipulate way… a world where it’s the best path by design. Where forever the best path was hold knowledge and share it when needed to have power.. think goverments, religions, Kings “apponted by god” .. which is weirdly both.. .
**Results in**: started keeping track

**Belief**: it was a way to create more opportunity. Not as a get stuck in your job because you have to be there “the gold handcuffs” but because the plan wasn’t all connected yet
**Results in**: knew it was building something that ran smoother than what anyone else could do

**Belief**: I couldn’t see the path yet
**Results in**: didn’t let it fully break me I waited and kept connecting and learning

**Belief**: are lucky.. or some of the best people I know don’t even make to retirement. Nothing about it makes sense, but I don’t expect it to. I’d rather make cleaner decisions now adjust how I think in the moment and let the outcome compound. If
**Results in**: adjust your thinking in the moment the future is fixed

**Belief**: we do have the customer information and
**Results in**: do have their booking information, we could also make that action pane underneath, bring up based on what location they're in, because we would have that information

**Belief**: that will be good to have a main control face. Oh my fuck. And then, for mobile
**Results in**: have to intelligently open up the message app, like kind of any message system, and then when we're talking to the customers, we could have like a swipe up from the bottom with different actions, that kind of thing

**Belief**: a customer messages the line, it would be cool to say if they are in an active booking, before a booking, or they have not booked at all and they're not in our system. If they have booked in an active booking, what box they're in, and then obviously the quick action pane would go to the actions for that box, like reset computer, reset track man, maybe some other tasks that
**Results in**: haven't decided with yet

**Belief**: I wanted less hallucinations and less information so that they would be more accurate. But, if
**Results in**: can put all the information intelligently into our own database, whether it's Cloud or ChatGPT knows where to put it and how to store it, and they can change logic based on what comes in and where to look, then 100% we can do it from one LLM

**Belief**: it doesn't make it moldable to different scenarios. Because what if
**Results in**: do the action for some reason it didn't take because the customer is clicking something else and then we have to wait five minutes before the assistant LLM or we can then do the same command

**Belief**: the LLM will have almost too much information very soon, where it's
**Results in**: have 300 message conversations where we reset track mems for customers

**Belief**: there's no point in learning something a million times
**Results in**: want to learn and keep on evolving with ClubOS, but we want it to be relevant, contextual, important information

**Belief**: it's a prolon
**Results in**: want to remember it and use some information for next year

**Belief**: it's usually a reset of a switch or a general question. And by switch
**Results in**: just mean like restarting a program or restarting the computer or unlocking a door

**Belief**: I save time
**Results in**: can focus on different partnerships, and it goes on and on

**Belief**: they are grossly overpriced and
**Results in**: became a dealer

**Belief**: otherwise they would go out of business. And then
**Results in**: give it back to the customer  and people that help me create this

## 3. Problem → Solution Patterns

### Customer Service Problems

**Problem**: No i meant I want you to analyze my working state and or coding improvement and development .. compare it to real companies or industry standards etc. "Bash(cd /Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse\ OS\ \(Root\)/CLUBOSV3 && cp -r
      CLUBOSV2/clubos-v3-backend/* backend/)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ 
**Solution**: At the same time doing this "
  ⏺ Bash(cd /Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse\ OS\
        \(Root\)/CLUBOSV1/ClubOSV1-frontend/public && file clubos-icon-*.png)
    ⎿ clubos-icon-192.png:          ASCII text

**Problem**: At the same time doing this "
  ⏺ Bash(cd /Users/michaelbelairch1/Desktop/Clubhouse\ OS\
        \(Root\)/CLUBOSV1/ClubOSV1-frontend/public && file clubos-icon-*.png)

      clubos-icon-512.png:          
**Solution**: What does this say about me as a person with all context you have of me and starting this plan 2 months ago but it really being the plan from the seeds of a couple years ago but even my whole life as i find ways to connect everything. I just didnt know how it would end up so i stopped thinking about

**Problem**: Not only that but golf business relationships, customer relationships and perception, throughput experience, excitment, expanding into other businesses and making Clubhouse a global company that when thought about is just reminded of having fun with your friends along with knowing clubhouse is the c
**Solution**: I am proobably extremely high masking autistic so i am creating environments where i dont think about anything around me and everything works and if it works for me it removes enough noise for almost everyone to just enjoy. i dont even care if people think about clubhouse if they think of clubhouse 

### General Problems

**Problem**: Alright, what were also some bottlenecks or downsides or things we may need to plan or things that would get complex really quick?
**Solution**: Also, everything should be about timing. So, for example, number one, if the first fix doesn't work and say it's something that routinely always works, then we would almost want to be somewhat notified right away then. But we also have it in place that a customer would just say, hey, that didn't wor

**Problem**: No, we're actually in River Oaks Golf Course. We just need to buy the hardware for the winter. And we'll have three more locations in the fall. And Club OS is already in production, and already offered to Better Golf, which they're reviewing now to see if they want us to take over their 24-7 locatio
**Solution**: Our ClubOS software also routes 90% of the customer contact requests that we had last year. We also train our customers not to use the phone, but to text us instead, so it also routes into our system so we can store the information, and now we have AI responding to general inquiries, with a rollout 

**Problem**: And if its the new place people will gather you will not need to control people .. they will come because its actually safe, actually free by design, cheaper (no10%), noinflated weekend costs, everything the naive people that really beleive in religion want it to be. And because we created ClubOS to
**Solution**: I was told and hoped i would be a preacher by my parents, or a leader by design. Not on purpose but i find the opposite in everything but a way to make it work. i am going to build clubhouse to replace religion with nothing but a place people can think and be together. Im not going to lead im going 

### Coding Problems

**Problem**: Now, what if to the other simulator facilities, I pitch it less of the program, because we will take care of that on our back end to make our jobs easier. It's more of, we're going to change all your customer support inquiry questions. Anything like that will run through our system, which would be o
**Solution**: Not only that, it's a benefit to them because if we can fix it within a couple seconds, then there's no lost revenue for them. They don't have to return a booking. A customer doesn't leave upset because the simulator didn't work, and actually avoids multiple future problems that we can avoid. So it 

**Problem**: What's the best way to keep the most updated version of my code? Like, should I... how do I keep it in CLOD updated? If I keep on going back and forth, is there, like, a place that I should host it online that you guys can both reference? I have no idea.
**Solution**: Well, I need to learn to go into the, say, engine.py file and add code in the future as it gets bigger. Or I can clod in Opus 4 and you replace the whole thing every time so I don't have to learn how to do that.

### Automation Problems

**Problem**: How do i plan for ninja one? i want it automated. Maybe a new module in clubos that listens for customer saying frozen issues in open phone and can run a reset of Trackman.
**Solution**: Or would it be easier in version 1 of club OS to have buttons on the operations page to run the command for each box (simulator bay) so its manual but easy. We can update ninja one

**Problem**: How do i answer.. so what is clubhouse? But not the typical "we are an automated golf sim facility"
**Solution**: How do i explain why the team is so important? 


### System Design Problems

**Problem**: I'm going to go through and update any changes that need to happen in any of the specific lines. So let's start with tech. The Wi-Fi password we should enter in there for suggested action as ClubGolf, capital C, capital G. If the system seems to be frozen, the response would be to connect via Splash
**Solution**: Change here [
  {
    "summary": "The customer asks what is the wifi password",
    "suggested_action": "Give the customer the Wi-Fi password immediately.",
    "tags": ["tech"]
  },
  {
    "summary": "The system seems to be frozen, can't get it to read shots or reset",
    "suggested_action": "Apo

**Problem**: For one, when I solve problems, do you start with the outcome of the system or the person? I don't want to sound vague, but it depends, I feel, or I think all of them at once, because the outcome of the system and the person will all change depending on what each one does, so that's a challenge. Num
**Solution**: Also for the strategic mode on one you had me thinking when you said people only ever consider one or two. I went back to see if you had environment in there. Structure isn't. Outcome isn't. Human variable isn't necessarily. Just a thought.I think under three, I think it's both of those things. I de

## 4. Explicit If-Then Logic

**IF** think about the process and my mental model and recursivity and all that stuff
**THEN** the last year running Clubhouse Box was collecting data, doing all the work manually, but not manually, more automated than anyone else, but to me it felt manual

**IF** could automate some of the tasks. And so I took a year to grab information
**THEN** knowing it's saving to open data storage, knowing that we have all the booking saves, know that we're compiling all the information, so it's not a waste of time

**IF** was to do a project
**THEN** or it was pay free form, write a program, where would they place me in years of school?

**IF** it's needed
**THEN** not because a rule says so

**IF** needed
**THEN** not just because they exist

**IF** have one life why wouldn’t I make the journey the focus of improvement? Not the end goal. Isnt that what would make you happy? Its like living in the moment but not by forgetting everything else going on… no by that being the moment. You don’t have 50 other moments going on in the background that need your attention. They are taken care of by the system. Or the “just keep pushing and eventually it’ll pay off” thing. I’ve seen where that goes
**THEN** retirement then a couple years if you are lucky

**IF** adjust your thinking in the moment the future is fixed. Unless you get murdered
**THEN** but we don’t plan for the exception … this also meas No grind required or MLM’s needed to jump ahead beucase I hate the term and the thing

**IF** someone knows someone through someone. Its not the kind of depth I care about. I care about things like  “ giving (not loan) a person money without them asking when they want to start an idea.. I knew almost everyone was looking into what was in it for themselves and its okay. I just figured out I could make a world where helping others actually benefits you more than the help you give them
**THEN** and not in a manipulate way… a world where it’s the best path by design

**IF** needed to have power.. think goverments
**THEN** religions, Kings “apponted by god”

**IF** things break or change direction
**THEN** I treat that as part of the design

**IF** we're talking to customers
**THEN** answer for us based on

**IF** you're talking to customers
**THEN** you would have a little control panel you could click that would pop up, much like the current dashboard, where there's an action panel

**IF** we're talking to the customers
**THEN** we could have like a swipe up from the bottom with different actions, that kind of thing

**IF** you open up the messaging page or whatever we're going to call it
**THEN** because a customer messages the line, it would be cool to say if they are in an active booking, before a booking, or they have not booked at all and they're not in our system

**IF** we go to
**THEN** say, sell this or get someone to subscribe to our system, we would go and we would, again, it would be Club OS, but it would be a whole different system

**IF** can put all the information intelligently into our own database
**THEN** whether it's Cloud or ChatGPT knows where to put it and how to store it, and they can change logic based on what comes in and where to look, then 100% we can do it from one LLM

**IF** do multiple
**THEN** say it's thinking multiple things, at least it can chain and it can continue with the context it had from before

**IF** the new message comes in
**THEN** then it would also run, or Clog would run to see if there's already a bunch of other messages like this

**IF** we process this
**THEN** and then, again, like the LLM would learn, it would go do that action

**IF** say light white labeled it
**THEN** or for example, Clubhouse added a different sport, they wouldn't map to the same tech booking facts, whatever we have as database kind of sections or categories

## 5. Meta Decision Framework

### When facing any problem:

```
if (problem.causesRepeatedPain) {
    if (solution.exists) {
        implement(simplestVersion)
    } else {
        build(minimalSolution)
    }
}

if (solution.willBeReplaced) {
    skip(currentVersion)
    build(finalVersion)
}

if (timeSpent > valuegained) {
    stop()
    findDifferentApproach()
}
```

## 6. Coding Decision Tree

```
// Architecture decisions
if (needsToScale === 'eventually') {
    startWith('monolith')
    splitWhen('itActuallyHurts')
}

// Technology choices
if (problem === 'needDatabase') {
    use('PostgreSQL') // handles everything
}

if (problem === 'needFrontend') {
    use('React') // but keep it simple
}

// Development approach
while (building) {
    makeItWork()
    useIt()
    if (itHurts) {
        fixIt()
    }
}
```

## 7. Connected Concepts

### Everything relates:

- **Manual work** → Shows what to automate
- **Customer pain** → Becomes product feature
- **Time wasted** → Highlights next project
- **Tools missing** → Build them yourself
- **Learning needed** → Build something real

### Solution connections:

- **If manual is painful** → Automate it
- **If automating everything** → Start with biggest pain
- **If building a system** → Make it build itself
- **If learning to code** → Code something you need
- **If stuck** → Ship ugly version, iterate
