# Production Readiness To-Do List
Last Updated: 2025-08-01

## üéØ Overview
This document tracks the implementation of missing core coding practices identified in the codebase audit. The goal is to bring ClubOS V3 to production-grade standards without adding unnecessary complexity.

## üî¥ Critical Priority (Must Have Before Production)

### 1. Testing Framework & Coverage ‚úÖ
**Current State**: Backend testing complete with 95.9% coverage
**Target**: 80% code coverage minimum (EXCEEDED!)

- [x] **Backend Testing Setup**
  - [x] Create `/backend/tests/` directory structure
  - [x] Write unit tests for core services (sopMatcher, intentClassifier)
  - [x] Add integration test setup for API endpoints
  - [x] Mock external API calls (OpenAI)
  - [x] Write tests for remaining services (actionExecutor, notifications)
  - [x] Add test:watch script for development
  
- [ ] **Frontend Testing Setup**
  - [ ] Configure React Testing Library
  - [ ] Write component tests for critical UI components
  - [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
  - [ ] Test Next.js API routes
  
- [x] **Coverage Reporting**
  - [x] Configure Jest with coverage in jest.config.js
  - [ ] Add coverage badges to README
  - [x] Set minimum coverage thresholds (80%)

### 2. Git Hooks & Code Quality ‚úÖ
**Current State**: Husky and lint-staged configured and active
**Target**: Automated quality checks before every commit

- [x] **Husky Setup**
  - [x] Install and configure Husky
  - [x] Add lint-staged configuration
  - [x] Create HUSKY_SETUP.md for git init instructions
  - [x] Initialize when git repo is created (active and working)
  
- [ ] **Commit Standards**
  - [ ] Add commitlint for conventional commits
  - [ ] Create commit message template
  - [ ] Document commit conventions in CONTRIBUTING.md

### 3. Security Hardening ‚úÖ
**Current State**: Security middleware implemented
**Target**: OWASP-compliant security headers and protection

- [x] **Security Middleware**
  - [x] Install and configure Helmet.js
  - [x] Implement rate limiting with express-rate-limit
  - [x] Add endpoint-specific rate limits (auth, messages, SOPs)
  - [x] Configure Content Security Policy
  - [x] Add comprehensive security headers
  
- [x] **Input Validation**
  - [x] Add Joi for request validation
  - [x] Create validation middleware with schemas for all endpoints
  - [x] Auto-sanitize and strip unknown fields
  - [x] Add SQL injection protection utilities
  
- [ ] **API Security**
  - [ ] Implement API key rotation strategy
  - [ ] Add request signing for internal services
  - [ ] Configure secure session management

## üü° High Priority (Should Have Soon)

### 4. Performance Monitoring
**Current State**: No monitoring
**Target**: Basic performance visibility

- [ ] **Application Monitoring**
  - [ ] Choose APM tool (New Relic, Datadog, or open-source)
  - [ ] Add response time tracking
  - [ ] Monitor database query performance
  - [ ] Track API endpoint usage
  
- [ ] **Error Tracking**
  - [ ] Integrate Sentry for error monitoring
  - [ ] Add source maps for better debugging
  - [ ] Configure error alerting
  
- [ ] **Health Checks**
  - [ ] Add /health endpoint
  - [ ] Include database connectivity check
  - [ ] Add external service checks

### 5. API Documentation
**Current State**: Basic markdown docs
**Target**: Interactive API documentation

- [ ] **OpenAPI/Swagger**
  - [ ] Install swagger-jsdoc and swagger-ui-express
  - [ ] Document all endpoints with OpenAPI spec
  - [ ] Add request/response examples
  - [ ] Generate client SDKs

### 6. Dependency Management
**Current State**: No vulnerability scanning
**Target**: Automated security updates

- [ ] **Security Scanning**
  - [ ] Add npm audit to CI pipeline
  - [ ] Configure Dependabot or Renovate
  - [ ] Create security policy
  - [ ] Regular dependency updates schedule

## üü¢ Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

### 7. Development Experience
- [ ] **PR Templates**
  - [ ] Create pull request template
  - [ ] Add issue templates
  - [ ] Document code review checklist
  
- [ ] **Developer Tools**
  - [ ] Add VSCode workspace settings
  - [ ] Create debugging configurations
  - [ ] Add recommended extensions

### 8. Advanced Monitoring
- [ ] **Metrics & Dashboards**
  - [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics
  - [ ] Create Grafana dashboards
  - [ ] Add business metrics tracking
  
- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - [ ] Configure k6 or Artillery
  - [ ] Create load test scenarios
  - [ ] Document performance baselines

## üìã Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Week 1) - Foundation
1. Testing framework setup
2. Write critical path tests
3. Add git hooks
4. Implement security middleware

### Phase 2 (Week 2) - Monitoring
1. Add error tracking
2. Implement health checks
3. Set up basic APM
4. Configure dependency scanning

### Phase 3 (Week 3) - Polish
1. API documentation
2. PR templates
3. Advanced monitoring
4. Load testing setup

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with tests** - Can't refactor safely without them
2. **Add hooks next** - Prevent bad code from entering
3. **Security third** - Critical for production
4. **Monitor last** - Need stable base first

## üìù Notes

- Focus on simplicity: Use well-established tools
- Automate everything: If it's manual, it won't happen
- Document as you go: Future you will thank present you
- Test in staging: All changes must be validated

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical items complete
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] < 200ms average response time
- [ ] Automated deployment with rollback
- [ ] Team trained on new tools
