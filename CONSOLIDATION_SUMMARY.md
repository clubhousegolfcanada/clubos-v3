# Documentation Consolidation Summary
Date: 2025-08-05

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Consolidated Files
- **AI_CONTEXT.md** - Merged 5 AI-related files into one comprehensive guide
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Combined naming conventions, coding standards, and development guidelines

### 2. Archived to planning-archive/2025-08-audit/
- 24 outdated/redundant files moved
- Includes old AI guides, planning docs, completed work
- Preserves history while cleaning up root

### 3. Updated Version References
- All active docs now show v0.7.0
- CURRENT_WORK.md updated to reflect actual status
- README.md simplified to reference new structure

### 4. Final Structure (Root .md files)
