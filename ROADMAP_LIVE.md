## 🏷️ Human-Tagged Additions

### Approved
```javascript
{
  "user_avatars": {
    requested_by: "@john",
    date: "2025-07-15",
    reason: "Operators want profile pictures",
    status: "planned",
    complexity: "medium"
  }
}
```

### Under Consideration
```javascript
{
  "multi_tenant": {
    requested_by: null,
    date: null,
    reason: "Potential enterprise clients",
    status: "researching",
    complexity: "high"
  }
}
```

### Rejected
```javascript
{
  "blockchain_integration": {
    requested_by: "@ai_speculation",
    date: "2025-07-01",
    reason: "No clear use case",
    status: "rejected",
    complexity: "very_high"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Flexibility Framework

### When to Add Features
```
IF human_request = true
  AND clear_use_case = true
  AND complexity_acceptable = true
  AND no_core_disruption = true
THEN approve_feature()
```

### When to Say No
```
IF speculative = true
  OR over_engineered = true
  OR breaks_core_flow = true
  OR no_clear_owner = true
THEN reject_feature()
```

## 📅 Release Planning

### v0.5.0 (Target: Sept 2025)
- Claude integration complete
- Real APIs connected
- Production deployment

### v0.6.0 (Target: Oct 2025)
- PWA support
- Enhanced analytics
- Performance optimizations

### v1.0.0 (Target: Dec 2025)

---

## 🚦 Development Philosophy

### Always
- Ship working increments
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document decisions
- Test critical paths

### Never
- Break production for features
- Add complexity without need
- Ignore operator feedback
- Assume over asking
