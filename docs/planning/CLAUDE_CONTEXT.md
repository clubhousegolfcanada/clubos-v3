# Claude Context & Progress Tracker for ClubOS V3 (Evolved from V2)

## üéØ Quick Start for New Chat
1. **Read This File First** - It tracks current progress
2. **Check V2_BUILD_ORDER.md** - For the build plan
3. **Check CURRENT_CHUNK_STATUS.md** - For what's in progress
4. **Read relevant architecture files** - Based on current chunk

## üìç Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-08-01)

### Overall Progress
- [x] Planning Phase Complete (V2)
- [x] Architecture Decisions Made (V2)
- [x] Database Schema Designed (V2)
- [x] **V2 Evolved into V3** - Ported good code from V1
- [x] Core Message Loop implemented
- [x] Intent Classification working
- [x] Thread Management active
- [x] SOP System with tagging
- [x] Action Framework operational
- [x] V1 Service Migration complete
- [x] **V3 Version 0.4.0 Released**

### Key Decisions Made
- ‚úÖ Using 7-assistant architecture (V3)
- ‚úÖ Database-only for SOPs (no Google Drive)
- ‚úÖ Technical approach (not human-logic)
- ‚úÖ Keep V1 running during build
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL for everything

## üìù Session Notes (Add after each session)

### Session 2024-07-30 (Initial Planning)
- Organized all V2 files
- Created V2_BUILD_ORDER.md
- Created V2_COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
- Archived outdated files
- Ready to start Chunk 1

### Session 2025-08-01 (V2 ‚Üí V3 Evolution)
- V2 planning successfully evolved into V3 implementation
- Ported valuable code from V1 (booking service, remote actions, notifications)
- Implemented V2's architecture vision with practical adjustments
- V3 now at version 0.4.0 with core functionality operational

### Session [DATE] (Next Session)
- [Add what was completed]
- [Add any blockers]
- [Add next steps]

## üî¥ Blockers & Decisions Needed

### Before Starting Chunk 1:
1. **OpenAI Assistant IDs**: Need from V1 or create new?
2. **Anthropic API Key**: Need for Claude integration
3. **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or Railway URL?

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
# From V1 (copy these)
DATABASE_URL=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=
OPENPHONE_API_KEY=

# New for V2
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
REDIS_URL= (optional for caching)
```

## üí° Claude Instructions

### When Starting a New Chat:
1. Ask user: "What chunk are we working on?" or "Should I check CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md?"
2. Read the relevant files for that chunk
3. Check if previous chunk is complete
4. Update this file after making progress

### After Each Work Session:
1. Update the progress checkboxes
2. Add session notes with date
3. Update CURRENT_CHUNK_STATUS.md
4. Commit with clear message: "feat(chunk-X): description"

### If Confused:
- Check V2_BUILD_ORDER.md for the plan
- Check V2_COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for data structure
- Ask: "Which chunk should I work on?"

## üéØ Next Actions for V3
