# Mike Brain Engine - Usage Examples

## What This Is

A decision-making engine that thinks like Mike. Not general AI knowledge - specific strategic thinking for business and technical decisions.

## How It Works

```javascript
// Ask it a question
const decision = await mikeBrain.makeDecision("Customers complain about slow bookings")

// Get specific strategy
{
  action: 'automate',
  approach: 'Build minimal automation for biggest pain point',
  steps: [...],
  reasoning: 'Time wasted on repetition is compounding loss',
  timeframe: 'Start today, ship within week'
}
```

## Real Examples

### 1. Customer Service Problem
**Input**: "Support team spends 3 hours daily on booking questions"

**Mike Brain Output**:
```javascript
{
  action: 'automate',
  approach: 'Build bot for most common questions first',
  steps: [
    'Log next 50 questions to find patterns',
    'Build simple bot for top 5',
    'Let human handle weird ones',
    'Add more patterns as they emerge'
  ],
  reasoning: 'Manual repetition = wasted time compounding',
  timeframe: 'Bot live in 3 days'
}
```

### 2. Technical Architecture Decision
**Input**: "System getting slow, thinking about microservices"

**Mike Brain Output**:
```javascript
{
  action: 'simple_solution',
  approach: 'Fix bottleneck, skip architecture change',
  steps: [
    'Profile to find actual slow part',
    'Cache that one thing',
    'Re-evaluate if still slow',
    'Probably fine now'
  ],
  reasoning: 'Microservices before needed = complexity waste',
  timeframe: 'Fixed today'
}
```

### 3. Business Strategy
**Input**: "Competitor launched similar feature"

**Mike Brain Output**:
```javascript
{
  action: 'connect_and_extend', 
  approach: 'Make our version connect to everything else',
  steps: [
    'See what they built',
    'Find what frustrates their users',
    'Build that connection/integration',
    'Our feature now does more with less'
  ],
  reasoning: 'Connected systems > isolated features',
  timeframe: 'Ship improvement this week'
}
```

### 4. Learning New Technology
**Input**: "Need to learn React for new dashboard"

**Mike Brain Output**:
```javascript
{
  action: 'build',
  approach: 'Build the dashboard while learning',
  steps: [
    'Start with ugliest version that displays data',
    'Google/fix each error as it comes',
    'Dashboard works = you learned React',
    'Pretty comes later if ever'
  ],
  reasoning: 'Learning without building = time waste',
  timeframe: 'Working dashboard in 2 days'
}
```

## API Usage

### Basic Decision
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/decision \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "problem": "Manual inventory tracking takes 2 hours daily",
    "context": {
      "type": "operations"
    }
  }'
```

### Customer Helper
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/customer/help \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "We want to automate our booking confirmations"
  }'
```

### Business Strategy
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/strategy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "runway": 6,
    "customerComplaints": 30,
    "competitors": 2,
    "automationLevel": 40
  }'
```

## Integration with Your Code

### Simple Integration
```javascript
const { mikeBrain } = require('./mike-brain-implementation')

async function handleProblem(problemDescription) {
  const decision = await mikeBrain.makeDecision(problemDescription)
  
  // Execute based on decision
  if (decision.action === 'automate') {
    return buildAutomation(decision.steps)
  } else if (decision.action === 'build') {
    return buildNewSolution(decision.steps)
  }
  
  return decision
}
```

### Advanced with Learning
```javascript
const { LearningMikeBrain } = require('./mike-brain-implementation')

const brain = new LearningMikeBrain()

// Make decision
const decision = await brain.makeDecisionWithLearning(problem)

// Execute and track outcome
const result = await executeDecision(decision)

// Brain learns from outcome
decision.trackOutcome({
  success: true,
  timesSaved: 3, // hours per day
  painReduced: true
})

// Future similar decisions will be better
```

### ClubOS Integration
```javascript
const { ClubOSDecisionEngine } = require('./mike-brain-implementation')

const clubOS = new ClubOSDecisionEngine()

// Any request goes through Mike's brain
app.post('/api/clubos/request', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await clubOS.handleRequest(req.body)
  res.json(result)
})
```

## Core Decision Logic

The engine follows Mike's actual thinking:

```
Problem appears
  ↓
Is it wasting time repeatedly?
  YES → Automate it (ugly is fine)
  NO ↓
  
Does a tool exist?
  NO → Build it myself
  YES → Is it good enough?
    NO → Build better version
    YES → Use it
    
Will this solution be replaced?
  YES → Skip to final version
  NO → Build simple version

Can this connect to existing system?
  YES → Extend what exists
  NO → Build standalone (but connectable)
```

## Why This Works

1. **Time-focused** - Every decision optimizes for time saved
2. **Connection-aware** - Looks for ways to connect solutions
3. **Skip-friendly** - Identifies when to skip intermediate steps
4. **Learning-enabled** - Gets better with usage
5. **Simple-first** - Always chooses simplest working solution

## Customization

Add your own patterns:

```javascript
class CustomMikeBrain extends MikeBrainEngine {
  constructor() {
    super()
    
    // Add domain-specific patterns
    this.patterns.domain_rules = [
      'If golf-related → Consider weather impact',
      'If payment-related → Use Stripe',
      'If UI-related → Mobile-first always'
    ]
  }
  
  // Override decision making for your domain
  async processDecision(context) {
    if (context.domain === 'golf') {
      return this.golfDecision(context)
    }
    
    return super.processDecision(context)
  }
}
```

## Results You Can Expect

- **Faster decisions** - No overthinking
- **Consistent approach** - Same thinking pattern
- **Time saved** - Focus on what matters
- **Connected systems** - Not isolated solutions
- **Learning system** - Gets smarter with use
